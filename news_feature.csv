""This is sheer negligence. There is a serious lacking of safety and traffic management in the project."" — Prof Hadiuzzaman of Buet.

The joys of the families of a newlywed couple were wiped out in the blink of an eye as a segment of a box girder fell on a car in the capital's Uttara yesterday, killing five including two children.

It happened at Jasimuddin Road intersection on Dhaka-Mymensingh highway around 4:00pm when a crane toppled while moving the precast concrete segment. The weight apparently was too much for the crane.

The groom's father Rubel Miah, 60, the bride's mother Fahima Begum, 37, aunt Jharna Begum, 26, and two children of Jharna -- Janatul, 6, and Zakaria, 4 -- died at the scene as more than half the car got crushed, police said, adding that they were from Jamalpur's Islampur upazila.

The newlyweds, Rezaul Karim Hridoy and Riya Moni, were taken to a hospital. Police said their injuries were not critical.

The groom's father Rubel, a businessman, was driving the car, said Rakib Hossain, a family member.

""Rubel's son got married on Saturday and the family in Kawla area [in Dakhhin Khan] was celebrating.""

The seven people in the car were going to the bride's home in Ashulia, said Mohammad Mohsin, officer-in-charge of Uttara West Police Station.

Dozens of precast girder segments like the one that caused the tragedy have been piled on the highway near Jasimuddin Road intersection.

The crane was lifting the segments from the pile and placing them on a tractor trailer on the busy highway.

Many have asked why traffic was not stopped during the activities and pointed out that this is the fourth serious accident at the BRT construction sites in one and a half years.

""Traffic should have been stopped at that time. But it was not done, a major failure."" — AKM Manir Hossain Pathan, chief engineer of RHD, one of the project implementing agencies

Prof Hadiuzzaman, director of the Accident Research Institute at Buet, said that not even the bare minimum safety measures were taken, adding that the authorities should have cordoned off the area to keep traffic from being exposed to the danger.

There should have been safety and traffic management plans as the construction site is on one of the busiest highways of the country.

""This is sheer negligence. They seriously lack safety and traffic management. We have not been able to ensure accountability,"" he told The Daily Star last night.

It should be investigated whether the crane was suitable to lift such a heavy load and if the operator had the skills and the licence.

Right after the accident, locals rescued the couple, witnesses said.

But firefighters, reaching the scene, tried in vain to rescue the others inside. Grieving family members gathered at the scene and broke down in tears.

Firefighters first tried to cut open a part of the car, which was pinned to the ground by the weight of the girder segment. They failed. Then another failed attempt was made to haul the box-girder segment away with an excavator.

After that, the excavator was used to right the crane and the girder segment moved away from the car, allowing the firefighters recover the bodies.

Accidents like this in the project are not unheard of. On July 15 this year, a construction worker of the BRT died after a crane fell on him in Chandana Chourasta area on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway in Gazipur.

On March 14 last year, at least six workers, including three Chinese nationals, were injured as a part of a girder fell on them near Dhaka airport.

The Tk 4,268.38-crore project was taken up to build a 20.50km dedicated bus service road from Dhaka airport to Gazipur. The project was originally supposed to be complete at a cost of Tk 2,037.85 crore by December 2016. The latest deadline expired in June this year but the project made only 78 percent progress at the time. Officials have proposed setting the new deadline to December next year.

AKM Manir Hossain Pathan, chief engineer of Roads and Highways Department (RHD), which is one of the four implementing agencies of the project, said not halting traffic was a major fault.

There could have been an error in the crane operation, he said, adding that the operator fled the scene after the incident.

Asked whether the crane was capable of doing the work, he said the crane had been used for the task earlier.

Talking to this correspondent after last year's incident, a consultant engineer said the contractor -- China Gezhouba Group Co Ltd -- was not supposed to do loading, unloading and lifting of viaducts in daytime.

Asked about the matter, Shafiqul Islam, managing director of Dhaka Bus Rapid Company Ltd, which is another implementing agency of the project, said the contractor was working round the clock as the project was behind schedule.

About whether the probe committee formed after last year's incidents found a lack of safety measures at the site, he said the safety recommendations made by the committee were implemented.

About yesterday's accident, he said the investigation would reveal whether the crane was faulty or the operator made an error.

ABM Amin Ullah Nuri, secretary of road transport and highway division, said a five-member committee led by Additional Secretary Neelima Akhter was formed and asked to investigate the accident and come up with a preliminary report within today and a full report in two days.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed deep shock at the tragedy, reports UNB.

In the month following the United Nations' High-Level Meeting of the General Assembly on Global Road Safety this summer, Bangladesh experienced one of its deadliest months on the road. Nearly 400 people were killed and almost twice that many injured in more than 300 road crashes during the Eid-ul-Azha holidays. That's the highest number of road deaths during the holiday festival since the country started collecting data in 2016.

Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are now the eighth leading cause of death worldwide, amounting to 1.35 million deaths and 50 million injuries each year. In Bangladesh, RTIs are among the leading causes of death and disability, killing approximately 25,000 people in 2016 and leaving 2.4 percent of road crash victims with a permanent disability, according to the Global Status Report on Road Safety.

In addition to their impact on public health and safety, RTIs are a major economic burden, costing the country approximately Tk 4,500 crore (USD 76 million) and accounting for approximately 1.5 percent of Bangladesh's GDP annually.

At its high-level meeting, the UN declared a second Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030 to reach its Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of a 50 percent reduction in RTIs and deaths worldwide. Bangladesh set similarly ambitious goals of reducing road traffic deaths and injuries by 20-25 percent by 2024 and 50 percent by 2030.

Yet, RTIs continue to climb in Bangladesh and around the world, though not for a lack of awareness.

The UN's first Decade of Action from 2011-2020 helped raise global awareness around the issue of road safety. In Bangladesh, a series of public protests in 2018 following the deaths of two students killed by a bus led to some modest improvements in how the country sought to address the epidemic of traffic injuries and deaths.

Yet, in Bangladesh and beyond, the decade was unable to decrease the number of RTIs, which is why we now find ourselves renewing efforts to solve this problem. Declaring action will not be enough this time; taking action is what we need now.

What's important to understand about this crisis is that nearly all of traffic-related injuries and deaths are preventable and predictable. But in order to prevent them, countries must prioritise road safety and implement evidence-based, systematic-level interventions that can save hundreds of thousands of lives.

The good news is we already know a great deal about what works.

In a series of papers published in The Lancet, one of us, together with colleagues, examined four risk factors – lack of helmet use, lack of seatbelt use, speeding, and drunk driving – that dramatically increase road fatalities. We found that if we implemented road safety interventions around these four key risks, up to 540,000 lives could be saved globally.

We also showed that improving emergency response and trauma care in low- and middle-income countries could save approximately 200,000 lives each year. In Bangladesh, RTIs are a major cause of admissions at primary- and secondary-level hospitals, accounting for about one in five injury-related admissions.

Though we have a growing body of evidence, fatalities continue to rise in lower-income countries while progress on road safety has slowed in higher-income countries. Why? Many countries and cultures remain in thrall to the automobile. As public health practitioners, we study how industry activities harm public health – what we call commercial determinants of health.

A vehicle-centric environment affects everything from our infrastructure choices and vehicle design to how we perceive so-called road traffic ""accidents."" Even the language we use to describe crashes is problematic. Calling something an ""accident"" connotes a blameless word that fails to account for predictable risks and generations of vehicle-centric policy decisions and design.

Like the Vision Zero campaign, which seeks to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries, we need a safety-first mentality that prioritises protecting people. Pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists make up more than half of crash victims globally. In Bangladesh, motorcycles made up nearly half of all crashes this year so far, making it an especially dangerous mode of transportation.

Installing better street design and lighting, signage, pedestrian measures such as footpaths and crosswalks, while truly enforcing lower speed limits and helmet laws, would significantly improve road safety. In fact, the World Bank approved significant financing for Bangladesh's road safety project to accomplish comprehensive measures like these in order to help meet its SDGs on road safety by 2030.

These are steps in the right direction, but it is also necessary to establish a lead agency that can work to address the burden of RTIs. Further, continuous monitoring and evaluation of road safety measures are crucial to maintaining a safety-first approach. In this instance, what we don't know truly can hurt us.

It is long past time to rethink how we're trying to solve this problem and to learn from past failures. We believe that we can make the next 10 years safer. It will take meaningful political and financial commitments from all countries – Bangladesh included – to make that happen. To continue down the road we're currently on will only lead to more unnecessary loss of life and heartbreak.

A huge number of people in Bangladesh are becoming victims of road accidents every year.

Families of those killed in road accidents said that the government should look after them by providing compensations.

Road safety experts said that the state should become more sensitive to the plight of road accident victims as the death of the principal earner of a family puts the family into grave sufferings.

The appeals for compen- sations should be accommodated as soon as possible on humanitarian grounds, they added.

Against this backdrop, World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims is going to be observed in Bangladesh as elsewhere across the world today.

The ninth chapter of the RTA 2018 requires a financial assistance fund to be set up, and administered by a trustee board, for giving compensation or treatment cost to the dead and injured victims of road accidents.

The finance ministry gave its nod for the draft Road Transport Rules on November 2 this year and sent it to the Road Transport and Highways Division for next actions.

The finance ministry also approved the sources of the fund, including vehicle owners and different government bodies, while the trustee board would determine the amount of compensation.

Bangladesh Road Transport Authority chair Nur Mohammad Mazumder told New Age on Thursday that following the enactment of the law a trustee board was established but the fund was not set up as the rules were yet to be framed.

‘Once the rules are framed, the fund will be set up and we will start giving compensation to road accident victims after they apply for it,’ he added.

As per the statistics compiled by the police, 3,186 were killed and 3,500 others injured in 3,776 road accidents between January and August this year.

The number of fatalities in road accidents between January and September in the year was 5,043 while 8,387 people were injured in the accidents, according to the non-profit organistion Road Safety Foundation, which prepares reports based on media coverages.

The RSF report showed that among the total road fatalities in 2022 so far, 4,024 or 79.7 per cent, aged between 18 and 65 years, belonged to the working class.

This report was presented by the PWAB secretary general Md Mozammel Haque Chowdhury.

As per the report, in the road accidents, 2,804 transport workers, 666 students, 114 members of law enforcement agencies, 117 teachers, 24 journalists, 31 doctors, 16 freedom fighters, and 133 leaders and workers of different political parties were killed, among others.

The highest 52.02 per cent accidents occurred on regional highways followed by 27.7 per cent on national highways and 11.88 per cent on feeder roads.

Out of all accidents, 5.67 per cent took place in the Dhaka city and 1.71 per cent took place in the Chattogram city.

In 2022, the highest death toll in a single day in road accidents was on July 29 when 44 people were killed and 83 injured in 27 road accidents.

According to the association, the causes of the accidents were reckless driving, over-speed, overtake, road construction defects, movement of unfit vehicles, carelessness passengers and pedestrians, unskilled drivers and driving under the influence of drugs.

The association urged the strict implementation of the Road Transport Act 2018 to check the situation on roads.",https://www.newagebd.net/article/190603/road-accidents-kill-9951-in-2022

With the framing of the rules, the law will be fully implemented in about four years after its enactment.

In the rules, there are provisions for providing Tk 5 lakh to Tk 1 lakh to the road crash victims based on the severity of the crashes.

On December 27 past year, the government issued a circular regarding the rules titled the Road Transport Rules 2022.

The rules include 12 chapters, 167 sections, nine schedules and 44 forms.

As per the chapter eight on compensation, treatment and insurance, the Trustee Board under the law will give financial assistance to the road crash victims using four standards.

The ninth chapter of the RTA 2018, says that a financial assistance fund will be formed by a trustee board to give compensation to the injured and the heirs of the dead victims of road accidents.

If someone dies or dies after suffering injuries in a road crash, the amount of onetime financial assistance will be maximum Tk 5 lakh.

As for the people who will lose any vital body part and the people who will be severely injured without the chance of returning to the normal life by treatment in road crashes the amount of onetime financial assistance will be maximum Tk 3 lakh.

The amount of onetime financial assistance will be maximum Tk 1 lakh for the people who will be severely injured with the chance of returning to the normal life by treatment in road crash.

For claiming compensation, the victims can apply to the trustee board within maximum 30 days of the accident.

For creating the financial assistance fund, the rules mentioned five sources with fixed token money – annual Tk 1,500 for bus, truck, covered van and prime mover, Tk 750 for minibus, mini truck and pickup van, Tk 500 for car, jeep and microbus and Tk 300 for three-wheeler and other vehicles and onetime Tk 1,000 for the motorcycle.

The rules have reduced the time for getting medium and heavy driving licence.

According to earlier rules, it requires at least three and six years’ experience to get medium and heavy driving licence respectively by a light driving licence-holder while as per the new rules a light driving licence-holder can have medium and heavy driving licence with at least one and three years’ experience respectively.

The rules also say that there will be 12 points for each driving licence which will be cut down in the cases of violation of traffic rules.

A driving licence can be cancelled if a licence holder loses all 12 points.

The rules allow the car owners to get number plate numbers by choice but by paying up to seven times extra fees.

The last chapter says about digitisation of all possible services and formation of a central database server for preserving all data of the services.

Earlier, the country’s traffic rule violations are being dealt with under the Motor Vehicle Rules 1984, which were framed following the abolished Motor Vehicles Ordinance 1983.

On September 19, 2018, Jatiya Sangsad passed the Road Transport Bill, replacing the Motor Vehicles Ordinance 1983, in the wake of a countrywide students protest after two college students were killed by a reckless bus in Dhaka on July 29 in the year.",https://www.newagebd.net/article/190775/bangladesh-govt-frames-rules-for-road-safety-law-after-4-years

Over 80 percent of the 7,713 road crash victims last year were aged between 18 and 65 years, the most productive segment of the population, Road Safety Foundation said yesterday.

The loss to the workforce caused by road accidents across the country amounted to Tk 23,460 crore, and the figure would be more than 1.5 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) if the property damages are also taken into consideration, it said.

According to the organisation, the number of road crashes and deaths last year were 27.14 percent and 22.74 percent higher than that of the previous year.

Motorcycles were involved in 2,973 road crashes, which left 3,091 people dead last year. The figures were 43.53 percent and 40.07 percent of the total crashes and deaths that year, the foundation said.

Prof AI Mahbub Uddin Ahmed, chairman of the foundation which compiled the data from media reports, revealed the information at a press conference at the Dhaka Reporters' Unity yesterday.

Earlier, Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity also said the number of road crashes and deaths increased last year. It said 9,951 people were killed in 6,749 road crashes last year.

Road Safety Foundation found 10 major reasons behind road accidents, including faulty vehicles, speeding, unskilled and unfit drivers, unfixed working hours for professional drivers, operation of slow-moving vehicles on highways, reckless bike driving by youths, poor traffic management, and extortion in the transport sector.

It also made 10 recommendations, including proper implementation of Road Transport Act-2018, fixing working hours for drivers, increasing the capacity of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), and halting operation of slow-moving vehicles on highways.

Such a grim picture indicates deteriorating road safety although a stringent road transport act was enacted in the wake of a massive students' movement in 2018 for safe roads.

The Road Safety Foundation said 7,713 people were killed and 12,615 injured in 6,829 road crashes last year.

Last year's figures were the highest since 2019, it added. The number of road crashes and deaths in 2021 were 6,284 and 5,371.

The organisation said the losses the country incurred in workforce last year due to road crashes is worth Tk 18,046 crores. However, the amount would be 30 percent higher as many road crashes went unreported, it said.

The platform used the method followed by International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP).

Mahbub said they could not assess the losses of property caused by road crashes as they did not get any information in this regard. But the actual losses would be three to four times higher than the media reported.

""Considering all these facts, the economic losses incurred last year may be more than 1.5 percent of the GDP,"" he said.

He said 6,276 people between 18 and 65, the productive segment of the population, were killed in road crashes last year. This was 81.36 percent of the victims who died.

BIKES THE MAIN CAUSE

Mahbub said the numbers of road crashes and deaths involving other vehicles remained almost unchanged in the last three years. Actually, the gradual rise in road crashes and deaths involving bikes is the main reason for the increase in the total number of road crashes and deaths, he added.

The foundation chairman said at least 3,091 people were killed in 2,973 bike-related road crashes last year. Of the dead, 76.41 percent were between 14 and 45 years old.

Head-on collisions between bikes and other vehicles caused 21.26 percent accidents while 32.22 percent accidents occurred after bikes fell into ditches as their drivers lost control and 44.87 percent accidents happened after other vehicles ran over bikes and 1.65 percent accidents occurred for other reasons.

Bike riders were solely responsible for 38.31 percent of the accidents, Mahbub said, adding that a large portion of bikers were youths who either don't know traffic rules or ignore them.

He said 1,627 pedestrians were killed last year. Of them, 479 were pedestrians aged between three and 11. They were killed on their way to and from school, playgrounds or while crossing roads near their homes, he added.

ACCIDENTS DOUBLED IN CAPITAL

At least 246 people were killed in 259 road crashes in the capital last year, which was 79.56 percent higher than that of 2021, the foundation said.

Of the victims, 60.53 percent were pedestrians.

In the absence of bypass, heavy vehicles ply streets of the capital after 10:00pm, resulting in high causalities at night (34.13 percent) and early morning (21.62 percent).

Lack of roads, operation of motorised and non-motorised vehicles simultaneously, occupation of footpaths by hawkers, and lack of awareness among road users were the main reasons behind the accidents.

Saidur Rahman, executive director, and Shahjahan Siddique, vice chairman, of the foundation also spoke at the programme.",https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/transport/news/road-accidents-eat-over-15pc-gdp-3214976

COUNTLESS lives are lost in road accidents every day. Many become injured and lead a miserable life. The death trap in road accidents seems unstoppable. We hear of various measures that the government takes to prevent accidents, but they have not stopped accidents; reckless driving has not stopped. This means that there are gaps in accident prevention measures or in their implementation.

It is important to stop the accidents as the rate of road accidents is very high. Statistics say that 80 per cent of road accidents happen because of reckless driving, over-speeding and driver’s carelessness. Driver should take rest after for four to five hours’ continuous driving. This is a rule. But none of the drivers follow this rule. With tired driving, the risk of accidents is becomes higher. This is mainly because of the excessive commercial attitude of transport owners. Strict monitoring and enforcement of laws are necessary to prevent this trend.

A recent report of Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Association, which works on road safety, says that the highest number of road accidents in eight years took place in 2022, with 6,749 accidents causing the death of 9,951 people and injury to 12,356 people. It is said that road accidents increased by 19.89 per cent and fatalities by 27.43 per cent in 2022 in comparison with 2021 figures.

The number of registered vehicles has also increased four times. It is said that motorcycles, easy bikes and three-wheelers have caused the highest number of road accidents and fatalities in the past eight years because of their free movement on national and regional highways in defiance of government orders.

The accident area analysis shows that 27.70 per cent of the total accidents took place in 2022 on national highways, 52.02 per cent on regional highways and 11.88 per cent on feeder roads. The analysis shows that 5.67 percent of the total accidents took place in Dhaka city, 1.71 per cent in Chittagong city, 0.99 per cent in level crossings.

Bangladesh Road Transport Authority records show that the number of registered motorcycles was 7.5 lakh in 2010 and an average of one lakh motorcycles had been added every year till 2014. But since 2015, motorcycle registration has increased at a high rate. The number of registered vehicles in Banglades now is 55 lakh and motorcycles alone accounts for more than 40 lakh. The Passenger Welfare Association says that the number of people left dead in motorcycle accidents in 2018 was 945, which reached 2,533 in 2022.

Motorcycles are 30 times more dangerous than four-wheeled vehicles. But for lack of development and inadequate availability of public transports and traffic congestion, people are encouraged to use motorcycles, adding to the risk of motorcycle accidents. Many of the motorcycle drivers are often reckless. Pedestrian death caused by reckless motorcycle driving has also increased.

There was a road safety movement in July 29–August 8, 2018 demanding that roads should be made safe. Two speeding buses collided on the Airport Road in Dhaka on July 29, leaving two students of Ramiz Uddin Cantonment College, Rajeev and Dia, dead. Ten other students became injured in the accident. The protest started by their classmates and it later spilled over to outlying areas. The students took to the streets with nine-point demands.

In fact, the road transport system is chaotic, which is evident in bus services of Dhaka. Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology research says that 53 per cent of road accidents happen because of over-speeding; 37 per cent because of driver’s carelessness; and the remaining 10 per cent because of defects in vehicles and environment.

The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority says that at least 5.5 lakh of the 55 lakh vehicles registered until 2022 were unfit. As of December 2020, the number of unfit vehicles was 4,81,029. Because of such reasons, the number of road accidents keeps increasing. A young man lost his hand when he was crushed by two buses, another was thrown into the river by the assistant of a bus driver, yet another was injured in the bus. The death of two college students on the Airport Road and the death of a student of Notre Dame College caused widespread criticism and protests.

About 30 years ago, the Nerapada Sadak Chai, or the Safe Road Movement, was initiated on October 22, 1993. Actor Elias Kanchan lost his wife Jahanara Kanchan in a road accident and started the movement. The cabinet meeting on June 5, 2017 made a decision to observe October 22 as National Safe Road Day. Since then, the day has been observed nationally. By celebrating the day, every year the public demand to make the roads and highways safe is raised aloud. But do people get any benefits? Have we have been able to make roads safe?

In an interview with BBC Bangla Services in September 2016, a bus driver attributed the majority of road accidents to drivers dozing off to sleep. He said that the drivers are tired as they mostly work for 24 hours. They are also tired because of the hot air from the engine which is always close to the driver and the external and surrounding noise. Moreover, they drive again the next morning after doing duty all night. How can someone drive for 24 hours? Accidents can happen in moments. The rush for an increased number of trips is also responsible for this. Because of overexertion, drivers fall asleep and cause accidents. I the drivers are allowed to work for short hours, the number of accidents will be reduced.

The Passenger Welfare Association has identified nine causes of road accidents, including reckless driving. Other notable causes are unfit vehicles and unskilled driving. The organisation has also made 12 recommendations to reduce the number of accidents. The recommendations include proper driver training, banning motorcycles around Eid time, post-Eid monitoring, adequate wages for driver and their assistants and an effective National Road Safety Council.

A timely road transport law has been a long-standing demand to prevent accidents. The law has been made but has not been properly implemented. There is no precedent for severe punishment of drivers responsible for accidents. Even the prime minister in June 2018 gave six-point instructions. They are meant to have alternate drivers on long routes, not more than five hours’ driving at a stretch, training for drivers and their assistants, the establishment of services centres or restrooms along the road at certain distances and the use of seat belts. The instructions have not been properly implemented.

Road safety is an important national issue. But the issue is not getting much importance. Every day, someone dies on the road and the death trap continues. This needs to end.

According to the World Health Organisation’s latest World Health Ranking published in 2020, Bangladesh ranks the 88th among 183 countries in road accident death rate. The death rate is 16.74 per 1 lakh, in a scripted answer, Obaidul Quader said.

Among other South Asian countries, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and India were ranked the 72nd, 82nd, 85th and 90th respectively in 2020 meaning that Bangladesh’s position was after India in terms of safe roads among the neighbouring countries, Quader also said.

In his question, Latif wanted to know whether the information that the death rate in road accidents in Bangladesh was the highest among the South Asian countries was true.

Responding to another query from AL MP Benazir Ahmed, the road transport and bridges minister said that a policy was being prepared to control unapproved vehicles like easybike, nasimon, karimon and votvoti.

‘Once the policy is finalised, a decision will be made regarding giving approval of such vehicles,’ he added.

Currently, the number of authorised (registered) vehicles of the BRTA is 55,82,310, the minister said,

At present, vehicles such as easybike, nasimon, karimon and votvoti are plying the roads without permission.

Rafiqul added that the body was sent to Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital morgue for a post-mortem examination.

Later, the police seized the bus but the driver and helper managed to flee the scene, the officer added.

The accident took place at about 1:00pm. Nadia was heading towards the Natunbazar crossing on a motorbike of her friend.

The bus hit the motorbike and Nadia fell on the road and the bus ran over her.

Nadia’s friend, the biker, was unhurt.

Following the accident, agitated students took to the streets in the Kawla foot-over bridge area on Sunday afternoon and evening and protested at the accident there.

Vehicles were seen stuck in a gridlock in Badda-Kuril from Airport Road area. Pedestrians were seen making their way around the traffic.

The police, however, moved them away at about 7:00pm and cleared the road for vehicular movements.

The students chanted slogans for safe roads and said that safety on roads was a far cry in the city as fatal accidents were taking place in almost every day.

Agitated students of Northern University also said that the lack of implementation of the safe road project made the city roads deadly.

They demand immediate arrests of the people involved in the accidents.

Meanwhile, Azadul Haque, 35, a security guard at a Denim factory in the Chandra area who, along with three other apparel workers, was hit by a truck in the Hartakitola area of Gazipur, said Atikur Rahman, officer-in-charge of Salna Highway police station.

‘Agitated workers torched a truck, vandalised over 50 vehicles and blocked the road for a few hours, creating traffic congestion for more than five kilometres. Vehicular movement resumed after police brought the situation under control and cleared the road,’ Atikur added.

In Faridpur, locals blocked the road for over an hour after setting a Star Line bus on fire.

The bus hit a motorbike and killed three people.

The people protested at the accident, but they withdrew after the police negotiated with them, said Bhanga highway police station officer-in-charge Md Taimur Islam.

The deceased are Main Uddin Sheikh, 35, his daughter Tabassum, 10, and Sourav Matubbar, 16.

‘Both the males died on the spot while Tabassum was pronounced dead by the attending doctors at a local hospital,’ Taimur said.

It is exhausting to have to confront news of traffic accidents every day, particularly when we come to learn that the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) has done little to prevent these accidents. According to our report, unfit vehicles have been causing increasingly more road accidents in recent years. This raises serious concerns about the BRTA's inspection quality and its process of issuing fitness certificates to motor vehicles.

Lately, multiple allegations have been brought against the BRTA for issuing fitness clearance certificates to vehicles without carrying out any inspection, which violates the Road Transport Act 2018, and other relevant laws. The most egregious example of this phenomenon came to light in a recent report by this daily. A mini truck, which had been seized by police during a robbery in Cumilla, was apparently given a fitness certificate while it was still in police custody. Last year, another vehicle involved in an accident case was given clearance without any inspection.

Sources at the BRTA confirmed that some unscrupulous officials were involved in this activity with brokers. This is unacceptable, not least given the fact that BRTA has increased its service fee by 233 percent, which is another burden on citizens during the worst cost-of-living crisis in over a decade. We would like to know what actions the BRTA has taken to identify the syndicate in question. And despite repeated reports, why has it failed to put an end to the mockery that the inspection process has been reduced to?

Earlier in 2020, the High Court issued a rule that no unfit vehicles should be allowed to ply our roads. The High Court also asked the BRTA and the IGP to explain what actions they had taken to address the increasing number of road accidents, while directing the authorities concerned to ensure that no vehicle could get fuel without valid fitness certificates. But the directions fell on deaf ears, as usual. A large number of vehicles are not even registered under the BRTA, which means they don't have any fitness reports, but are still plying the streets, endangering people's lives.

The BRTA's failure gives us a glimpse into the sorry state of road safety in our country, despite a number of protests and strong citizen activism in recent years seeking specific redress. We, too, have repeatedly urged the BRTA to take its mandate seriously. We ask again that it makes its services transparent, accessible, and modern. Corruption that has become ingrained within its activities – and, dare we say, its ethos – must be exposed. The BRTA cannot take its role lightly, as people's lives depend on it.",https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/how-long-brta-does-its-part-3238721

Of the total 2022 road mishap casualties, 1,143 were children aged 3 months to 17 years, said a recent report by the foundation which promotes road safety in the country through training and advocacy.

The report, based on data from nine national dailies, seven online news portals, and electronic media, added that of these children, 32.19% were killed as passengers of various vehicles, 41.90% were killed while crossing the road and walking along the road, 7.34% were killed as drivers of trucks, pick-up vans, tractors, trucks, three-wheelers, and their helpers while 18.54% of children were killed as motorcyclists or pillions.

Experts suggest the practice of fastening seat belts and the use of child-friendly seats in vehicles can prevent child casualties on the road.

In 2019, the number of children casualties in the country was more than 600 which increased in the following two years taking it over the one thousand mark.

Ilias Kanchan, chairman of Nirapad Sarak Chai, said child-friendly seats are added to vehicle seats in different countries of the world, considering the age and height of children. It helps reduce the risk of child death caused by road accidents.

According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the use of child-friendly seats in vehicles reduces the risk of injury in road accidents by 71%–82% for children, when compared with seat belt use alone. Booster seat use reduces the risk for serious injury by 45% for children ages 4–8 years, when compared with seat belt use alone. Seat belt use reduces the risk of death and serious injury by about half for older children and adults.

While analysing the types of road accidents that killed children, 16.09% were killed in accidents on highways, 27.90% on regional highways, 41.73% on rural roads, 13.03% were killed on city streets, and 1.22% in accidents on other places.

Moreover, 13-17 age group children are on the top in the mortality rate caused by road accidents with 49.95%. Besides, 427 children were killed in road accidents while going to school and returning home and 119 children were killed on roads while playing nearby their houses.

Saidur Rahman, executive director of the Road Safety Foundation, told TBS that the country's roads and road transport are not child-friendly. No vehicles are suitable for children. Moreover, children do not know any rules regarding the use of roads.

""There is no concern among the authorities concerned on the matter. Similarly, there is no visible initiative to create any kind of awareness among the common people. But children are the victims of this mismanagement,"" he added.

Nur Mohammad Mazumder, chairman of the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, said the existing regulation mentions separate seating arrangements for children in the vehicles. BRTA is working on it so that manufacturing companies give priority to the issue of children while making seats, and those who import seats also give importance to the issue.

Out of 167 rules, only five mention road safety issues. The rest have given importance to issues related to the road transport system, they added.

The National Heart Foundation of Bangladesh organised the event at Daily Star's Shaheed Azimur Rahman Conference Hall in the capital city on Wednesday.

Dr Mahfuzur Rahman Bhuiyan of the National Heart Foundation Hospital and Research Institute's Road Safety and Injury Prevention Program suggested implementing the five pillars outlined in the United Nations Second Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030 to prevent premature deaths. The five pillars include safe road management, safe roads, safe motor vehicles, safe road users, and post-accident management.

These pillars have been successfully used in other countries to prevent road crashes and save people from injury.

Dr Mahfuz also emphasised the importance of addressing the five behavioural risks identified by the World Health Organization, which include reducing speed, wearing seat belts, using proper helmets, not driving after having alcohol, and arrangement of special seats for children.

Some 23,166 people die in road accidents annually in Bangladesh according to the centre for injury prevention and research, Bangladesh (Ciprb) and the health ministry statistics.

President of Bangladesh Orthopaedic Society Professor Dr Monayem Hossain said, around 300 patients come to the emergency unit of the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation (Nitor) daily. Some 40% of them are road accident victims. Most of the road accident victims are from the 18-45 age group, mostly the lone-earning member of their families.

It is not enough to formulate some road transport rules to prevent road crashes. Rather, it is necessary to execute the law which helps decrease 40% of the number of accident victims and mitigate the financial loss of the country and families, he added.

National Heart Foundation of Bangladesh Secretary General Professor Dr Khandkar Abdul Awal Rizvi said the government needs to set priorities. The first of these five pillars is management. The management should be fixed and the existing traffic system should be utilised properly.

""To make roads safer, vehicles' speed have to be controlled; riders have to wear seatbelts properly and the use of standard helmets must be ensured. Besides, proper treatment of injured persons and arrangements regarding rehabilitation for accident victims must be ensured,"" said Abdul Awal Rizvi.

Speakers in the event said if the condition of roads improves in this country, the speed of vehicles as well as accidents increases. But other countries curtail accidents by controlling speed. Decreasing road crashes will help decrease untimely and preventable deaths.

MUMBAI, India — It felt like an earthquake. That's what shopkeeper Safayet Hossain told local media after an explosion blew out the first two floors of a multistory commercial building Tuesday in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka.

The blast was near his shop in the city's old quarter. He said he saw 20 to 25 people lying in the road in front of the damaged building.

At least 17 people were killed, and more than 100 were injured. Officials say the death toll is likely to rise.

The blast hit just before 5 p.m. local time, the end of the work day, in a building that houses a plumbing supply shop and other businesses in a busy commercial district. Electricity was severed for a city block in either direction, and police cordoned off streets.

Officials say they're investigating the cause of the blast, and that a bomb squad is on the scene. One official told reporters at a nearby hospital that it appeared to be an accident. In the past 48 hours, there have been two other blasts blamed on gas leaks in the city.

Over the past decade, there has not been a single conviction in any major fire, and in most cases, the affected establishments went back to business as usual the minute media attention shifted.

Legal experts said the main reason for this is that the victims are poor and vulnerable and the perpetrators are influential enough to manage the cases.

Between 2020 and 2022, there were 13,726 fires in industrial and commercial establishments. The number includes cases of fires caused by boiler explosions or gas leaks.

At least 256 people died in these incidents, and of them 13 were firefighters killed in industrial fires. The fires also caused losses worth at least Tk 291 crore.

Yet, the count of convictions is zero.

""When it comes to investigations, things don't move. Witnesses refuse to show up at court to testify because of the fear of reprisal,"" said Jyotirmoy Barua, a human rights expert.

""The court is still only a place for the rich and the powerful,"" he said.

Khandaker Golam Moazzem, research director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said the government is still at the stage where it is assessing the safety concerns at factories. Apart from garment industries, no remedial steps have been taken for any other industries or commercial establishments.

""We do not see them [government] take any big steps and even after large disasters, most [factories or businesses] have been given the permission to reopen and operate.

""A reason why unsafe factories continue to operate is because the Department of Inspection of Factories and Establishments and the fire service do not have the power to shut down factories,"" said Moazzem.

The deadly fire at the BM Container Depot in Chattogram's Sitakunda on June 4 last year shook the whole nation with the scale of the disaster and its sheer human cost. Yet, it has now become a distant memory.

The fire killed 48, including 10 firefighters, and the depot was up and running within five months.

The Detective Branch of police in Chattogram is still investigating the incident and it is yet to submit a report. Nobody is in jail in connection with the incident.

While investigators were dragging their foot with the probe, there was another fire at the very depot in December, indicating lessons were not learnt.

On July 8, 2021, a fire at a factory of Hashem Foods and Beverages Ltd killed 51 people, of whom at least 20 were children.

The children were engaged in hazardous labour at the factory, and the gates were locked, preventing them from escaping the fire.

Hashem Foods and Beverages Ltd is yet to suffer any consequences. All its units in Rupganj of Narayanganj are running at full throttle, except the one that got burnt down.

Owner Abul Hashem and his four sons were released on bail within a month of their arrests.

Nearly two years on, the Criminal Investigation Department is yet to finish the probe.

Interestingly, a month prior to the incident, the DIFE had filed a case with the labour court against Hashem Foods citing safety rules violations. Even this trial has not been completed, said investigators.

On Sept 10, 2016, a boiler exploded at a foil-producing factory in Tongi's BSCIC industrial area killing at least 34 people.

Tampaco Foils Ltd in 2019 started a ""new state of the art plant with most advanced technology, machinery, safety and compliance features ensuring modernaisation and expansion"", according to its website.

""Every single work-related accident with injury to a person is one accident too many!"" read the company's website, which has no mention of the 34 people who died within its walls.

Officials at Tampaco said nobody at the factory has been convicted and that the police have not been able to prove anything.

Officer-in-Charge Mohiuddin of Tongi (east) Police Station does not even know what happened to this case. ""Following the incident, the Tongi police station was split into east and west stations and the case got lost during the process,"" said Mohiuddin.

Bangladesh Legal Aid Services Trust, Ain o Salish Kendra, and others had filed a writ petition with the High Court seeking its directives for adequate compensation for the victims. The writ is still at the hearing stage, said lawyers.

There is another similar cry for compensation that went unanswered.

In 2020, the workers of Tazreen factory spent up to a month on the sidewalk in front of the National Press Club demanding that they be compensated according to section-121 of the International Labour Organisation.

The section states that the victims must be compensated according to the amount they would have earned in their remaining working lives.

Shahbagh police eventually charged truncheon on them and beat up the handicapped workers to chase them away.

Meanwhile, the owner of the factory was able to climb the political ladder. He joined ruling party politics in 2018 and in May last year, he was elected president of Matshajibi League's Dhaka city north unit.

At the court, the trial goes on at snail's pace with the recording of a handful of witnesses' testimonies in seven years.

On Dec 24, 2021, a fire broke out in the engine room of MV Abhijan-10 on the Sugandha river in Jhalakathi. At least 41 died.

Vessel owner Hamzalal Sheikh and two others were arrested but they are now out on bail.

Even in the case of the Rana Plaza collapse, the worst disaster in Bangladesh's history that caused 1,140 deaths, only one out of the 41 people accused is in jail.

The charges were framed in 2016 but none of the 40 could be arrested in six long years.",https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/accidents-fires/news/deaths-wont-stop-justice-mirage-3267276

At least 19 people have been killed and up to 25 were injured in Bangladesh after a bus smashed through a highway fence and plunged into a roadside ditch in Bangladesh.

The police said they suspected the driver lost control at 8am (02:00 GMT) on Sunday and hit the railing of a recently built major expressway, sending the bus, carrying more than 40 passengers, tumbling nine metres (30 feet) into the ditch.

“The death toll has risen to 19. At least 12 people were critically injured. They have been sent to Dhaka Medical College Hospital in the capital,” local police chief Masud Alam told AFP news agency after the crash in the southern district of Shibchar.

The death toll could rise further as some of the injured passengers are in critical condition, said Anowar Hossain, police official of Shibchar, where the crash occurred.

The city is 80km (50 miles) from the capital Dhaka.

Road accidents are frequent in Bangladesh due to old and badly maintained vehicles and roads, as well as poorly trained drivers. Fatal road accidents have been on the rise despite the government saying it will reduce them by 50 percent by 2030.

With frequent road crashes taking place across the country, Bangladesh severely lacks post-road crash care for injured victims.

Due to the absence of such care, the number of deaths and disabilities from road accidents gets high and often creates heavy financial burden for families of victims, health and road safety experts observed.

Devastating road crashes are common in Bangladesh — which is regarded as one of the major reasons against establishing road safety.

At present, in emergency cases, injured victims are taken to upazila health complexes and, in critical cases, they are referred to medical college hospitals.

On Sunday morning, 19 people, including all three bus workers, were killed and about 20 more injured as an Emad Paribahan bus fell into a roadside ditch on the Dhaka–Mawa–Bhanga expressway at Kutubpur under Shibpur upazila of Madaripur district.

Madaripur deputy commissioner Rahima Khatun told New Age that they had sent 17 injured people to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where two more died later.

It is a very common situation in Bangladesh that people with serious injuries from most road crashes die on their way to or on their arrival at specialised hospitals as they fail to get emergency special care near the accident spot.

If anyone receives severe injuries to limbs, they are sent to the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation for long-term treatment.

Though there are six trauma centres in the country under the health and family welfare ministry for giving emergency care to road accident victims, these centres are almost non-functional now.

For taking injured people from the accident spot to nearby hospitals, Bangladesh also suffers shortage of ambulances while ambulance services are expensive.

In violation of a 2018 High Court directive, most private hospitals do not admit road crash victims for providing treatment to them.

With all these deficiencies, compensations from a designated fund under the Road Transport Act-2018 are yet to be disbursed.

Examples can be taken from a particular highway-side village to highlight various aspects of almost the non-existent post-road crash care facilities in the country.

Some locals of Durgapur village on the Dhaka–Chattogram national highway under Chauddagram upazila said that nearly all families in the village had lost at least one relative in road accidents.

Khorsheda Begum, living at the village for 22 years, said that her neighbour Joynal’s son Rifat recently suffered critical injuries when a vehicle hit him while he was crossing the highway that divides the village.

‘He was sent to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, from where he came back early as he could not afford to have a family member with him as an attendant at the hospital in the expensive capital city. He is now staying at Chauddagram sadar for treatment, accompanied by a family member, with whatever financial help his family can muster from others,’ she narrated.

What is even more tragic, Khorsheda disclosed that her seven-year old son Arif died in 2001 when an ambulance hit him on the same road.

‘I did not get any financial support from the government till date, but had to spend Tk 20,000 for ambulance and other purposes,’ she added.

Shabana Begum, wife of Md Zafar, another inhabitant of Durgapur village, said that her husband was a victim of a 2020 road accident on the same road, which left him both mentally and physically disabled.

‘I arranged treatment for him for two years, but now I have nothing more left to continue his treatment,’ she said.

According to the Bangladesh Police, 4,638 people were killed in 5,200 road crashes in 2022.

The police statistics on road accidents are based on the First Information Reports prepared by the police after the accidents, in which those who die afterwards in hospitals or other places are not included.

These statistics are the official road crash data provide by the government.

According to Rashid-E-Mahboob, former president of the Bangladesh Medical Association, post-road crash care facilities and quality medical services in Bangladesh are rare and unsatisfactory.

In Bangladesh, the ‘golden hours’ for the treatment of road crash victims are lost as the capacity to provide necessary care and services to such victims is rare, he said, adding that only six trauma centres are there in the country under the health ministry but these, too, are not functional.

Rashid-E-Mahboob, also a former vice-chancellor of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, further said that the ambulance services in the country — both in number and quality — were also rare.

‘The government is responsible for providing these facilities and if the government does not do that, then who would?’ he asked.

Professor Shamsul Hoque, a road safety expert and a former director of the Accident Research Institute, said that Bangladesh lacked hospitals equipped for treating road crash victims as well as adequate ambulance services to quickly take such victims to health facilities.

The chances of carrying road crash victims to facilities are especially low if accidents take place in remote areas, he observed.

He viewed that all hospitals must have qualified paramedics and a trauma section to treat road crash victims in order to minimise damages and save lives.

The health ministry should come forward to conduct monitoring if private hospitals have built trauma corners and if they treat road crash victims, the professor further viewed.

In Bangladesh, the majority of road accident victims take treatment at public hospitals as private facilities usually refuse to treat them.

The High Court Division in a ruling on August 8, 2018 directed the health ministry to make it mandatory for private hospitals and clinics to provide emergency medical treatment to road accident victims.

Rashid-E-Mahboob, replying to a question, asked as to who would foot the bill for road accident victims treated at private facilities.

‘So, in the event of an accident, you will be lucky if you get help in time, otherwise you’ll need to crawl to a hospital,’ he said, adding, ‘We need a national policy to address these issues, and decisions from policy makers in this regard.’

Health and family welfare minister Zahid Maleque on March 19 in a written statement told New Age that they were rearranging the entire health system in Bangladesh by giving special focus on primary health services.

In the country, frequent road accidents, especially motorcycle accidents, take place, he said.

‘For this reason, we are planning to work further on this issue,’ he said, adding, ‘We have, meanwhile, increased the number of ambulances so that road crash victims can access quick treatment.’

‘The government is also working to fix the fees of services at private hospitals,’ he said, adding, ‘Along with the public health facilities, the government is giving advice to private hospitals for increasing the quality of their services.’

Authorities have so far received only five applications from road crash victims for compensation since the formulation of the Road Transport Rules in late December of 2022.

The Road Transport Act was enacted in September 2018 following a countrywide student protest for road safety.

No victims have yet received compensation from the financial assistance fund under a trustee board, confirmed BRTA chairman Nur Mohammad Mazumder on March 15.

‘We are progressing step by step in raising the fund. Hopefully, within six months we will be able to start providing compensation to victims,’ he said.",https://www.newagebd.net/article/197453/care-crisis-behind-high-road-crash-deaths

The incident in the southern province of Asir highlights persistent challenges to safely transporting worshippers to Makkah and Medina, the holiest cities in Islam.

It comes during the first week of Ramadan, a busy time for umrah pilgrimages, and just months before millions of Muslims are expected to make the annual hajj pilgrimage.

‘According to preliminary information we have now received, the number of deaths in this accident reached 20, and the total number of injuries was approximately 29,’ the state-affiliated Al-Ekhbariya channel reported.

It said the victims had ‘different nationalities’ but did not mention them or provide a breakdown.

The channel said the bus had ‘car trouble’, without specifying, while the private newspaper Okaz said the accident resulted from an issue with the brakes.

The vehicle ‘then collided with a bridge, overturned and caught fire’.

Footage broadcast on Al-Ekhbariya showed a reporter standing in front of what appeared to be the burnt-out shell of the bus.

Transporting worshippers around Saudi Arabia's holy sites is a perilous task, particularly during the hajj, when roads can be chaotic with buses creating interminable traffic jams.

2023-03-31,['madaripur'],"[2.0, 19.0]",[],[],[],['bus'],vehicle-human,"Fatal road crashes continue to rise in Bangladesh despite government steps to halve the number of injuries and deaths from such crashes by 2030 as per the target of the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations.

Before the SDGs were set, the government had failed to cut deadly road accidents and resultant deaths and injuries in the country by 50 per cent as per an earlier similar target set 28 years ago.

According to road safety experts and campaigners, the government is far from improvements needed to achieve the road accident SDG as it has failed to ensure safety on roads.

Many initiatives have, meanwhile, been taken, including the enactment of a law, the formation of a taskforce and committees which gave recommendations from time to time, but almost all of the measures just exist on paper, said the experts and campaigners.

The measures are in conflict with the interest of transport owners and a section of lawmakers and law enforcement agency members, the campaigners also alleged.

Numerous irregularities, including the movement of unfit vehicles on roads, no control on vehicle speeds, drivers without licences or proper licences and a poor traffic management system, have plagued the road transport system — resulting in high casualties.

Incomplete and under-reporting of road crashes is also another problem in achieving the goal, said the experts and campaigners, urging the government to bring order on roads and its systems to ensure road safety.

Back in 1995, the government constituted the National Road Safety Council, comprising 24 agencies, as the umbrella authority for approving, implementing and monitoring road safety activities.

The council was created with the stated objective to cut fatal road crashes by 50 per cent in 15 years.

According to Bangladesh Police records, 1,653 people were killed and 2,864 injured in 3,346 road crashes during 1995 while 2,646 were killed and 1,803 injured in 2,827 accidents during 2010 — after 15 years.

Failing to achieve the target the NRSC , in November 2017, approved the 8th National Road Safety Strategic Action Plan with the aim of achieving the SDG target 3.6 of halving the number of deaths and injuries from road crashes by 2020 in line with the then Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–20.

But instead of going down, the numbers of road crashes and the resultant fatalities and injuries went up from 2011 to 2020, as per the police statistics.

During 2011, 2,546 people were killed and 1,641 injured in 2,667 road crashes while during 2020, when movements of all road transports remained suspended for two months in a row after the Covid outbreak in Bangladesh, 3,918 people were killed and 3,826 injured in 4,198 road crashes, show the police data.

According to a World Bank report titled ‘Delivering Road Safety in Bangladesh: Leadership Priorities and Initiatives to 2030’, published in 2020, while the government figure of deaths from road accidents was 2,538 in 2015, it was actually about tenfold — between 20,736 and 21,316 —in that year, said the World Health Organisation.

‘The pictures in the government statistics and on the ground are quite different,’ said AI Mahbub Uddin Ahmed, a supernumerary professor of sociology at Dhaka University and the chairman of non-governmental organisation Road Safety Foundation.

The UN General Assembly in September 2020 adopted a resolution titled ‘Improving global road safety’ proclaiming the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021–2030, with the ambitious target of preventing at least 50 per cent of road traffic deaths and injuries by 2030.

After the 2020 UNGA resolution, the National Road Safety Council in November 2022 approved the Ninth National Road Safety Strategic Action Plan for 2021–2024 with the goal to reduce the road accident fatalities and injuries in Bangladesh by 20 to 25 per cent by 2024 and by 50 per cent by 2030.

According to the police data, 4,636 people were killed and 4,444 injured in 5,089 road crashes during 2022 in place of 5,088 deaths and 4,709 injuries in 5,472 road accidents during 2021, showing that the fatality rate went down by about 9 per cent from 2021 to 2022.

But the Passenger Welfare Association of Bangladesh, a non-governmental organisation, which compiles road crash data based on news media reports, disclosed that 9,951 people were killed and 12,356 injured in 6,749 road crashes during 2022 while the 2021 corresponding figures were 7,809, 9,039 and 5,629, with the fatality rate going up by 27.43 per cent in the one year.

Professor Md Shamsul Hoque, a road safety expert and a former director at the Accident Research Institute, said that Bangladesh was far from nearing the achievement of the target of bringing down the number of road crash casualties.

The country lacks, he pointed out, four main factors for achieving the goal, which are safe infrastructure, fit vehicles, skilled drivers and good operating conditions of roads.

‘The mechanism to check vehicle fitness is a mockery now,’ he said, adding that skilled drivers and safe road operating condition — marked by features like no parking of vehicles and no movement of slow-moving vehicles on highways — are also absent in Bangladesh.

Against the backdrop of frequent fatal road accidents and a countrywide student agitation for safe roads in 2018 after two college students were killed in a road crash in the capital, the government enacted the Road Transport Act 2018, which is yet to be fully implemented.

Even before the road safety protests, prime minister Sheikh Hasina on June 25, 2018 directed the relevant authorities to ensure facilities for drivers to have rest every five hours, back-up drivers for long-distance transports and the use of seatbelts during travels.

However, the directives remain unimplemented till date.

The High Court earlier, on August 3, 2015, issued a directive to the road transport ministry and the police to keep unfit motor vehicles off the roads across the country.

The road transport and bridges ministry earlier, on August 1, 2015, banned three-wheelers and non-motorised vehicles on different national highways.

Neither the High Court directive nor the ministry ban was fully implemented, observed road safety experts.

On April 28, 2019, a committee, headed by former shipping minister Shajahan Khan and the executive president of the Bangladesh Road Transport Workers’ Federation, submitted 111 recommendations to the prime minister to bring back order on the roads and arrest road crashes.

The PM, court directives, and committee recommendations have been incorporated in the RTA, the Bangladesh Labour Act 2009 and the traffic laws.

For example, in the March 19 Madaripur bus crash that killed 19 people, the bus did ran without fitness certificate and the driver did not have the licence to drive the bus.

According to AI Mahbub Uddin Ahmed, the existing laws and recommendations go against the interests of transport owners and a section of lawmakers and law enforcement agency members.

Professor Shamsul Hoque added that the government also lacked accurate data necessary for preparing a road map for reducing casualties.

The government, he advised, should have pursued some targeted reduction of road crashes, which was not done till now.

Passenger Welfare Association of Bangladesh secretary general Mozammel Hoque Chowdhury said that the government, despite various plans, could not bring down road crashes due to the lack of accountability and skills.

He alleged that road traffic mismanagement also continued because of the interest of owners and inefficient government officials.

BRTA chairman Nur Mohammad Mazumder on Thursday told New Age that the government had taken many initiatives, including the formulation of action plans, recommendations, a taskforce and a law which were under implementation.

Asked if he is satisfied with the achievement these measures made, he said, ‘We are trying our best with all the capacities we have, but there are many challenges.’

They need to work in cooperation with others to implement the measures, he added.",https://www.newagebd.net/article/198262/bangladesh-unlikely-to-achieve-sdg-set-for-road-safety

Sirajul Islam, another shopkeeper, rushed to the market, hearing news of the fire.

""I have clothes worth Tk 20 lakh in my shop. I could manage to take out almost half of the product but those were destroyed and rendered unsellable due to the water [from the firefighters' hoses],"" he said.

Another businessman Rakib said he could not take out a single piece of clothing from his shop.

The fire, which occurred just over two weeks before Eid, has destroyed most of the valuable goods in these stores.

Many people from nearby markets were also seen taking their belongings out of the area, with everyone occupying the street with their possessions.

One of the affected businessmen, Didar Hossain, expressed his heartbreak, saying, ""I had a shop with new clothes worth Tk 10 lakh for Eid. Everything has turned to ashes.""

The World Bank in March last year approved a loan for the biggest road safety project in Bangladesh. The loan contract with Bangladesh authorities has to be signed within one and a half years of the approval, or else, the loan would be cancelled, said officials.

One year has already gone by, but the project has not been approved yet, a pre-condition for signing the loan deal, rising concern over the fate of the project's funding, they said.

The Tk 4,988.14 crore project now has to get the nod within three or four months by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council, because it takes some time to issue office order regarding the approval, they added.

After changes in the Development Project Proposal, the Roads and Highways Department, the lead implementing agency of the project, re-submitted it to the Road Transport and Highways Division on Sunday.

RHD sources said WB already wrote to the authorities concerned to complete the DPP approval process quickly.

Any project, after submission of the DPP by the implementing agency concerned, usually goes through a lengthy process that include several meetings involving different agencies. It takes quite a long time. So, the fate of the project depends how quickly the process will be completed and how fast the Ecnec approves it, the officials said.

The project proposal is now with the Planning Commission and its approval is expected soon — ABM Amin Ullah Nuri Road Transport and Highways Division Secretary

The deadline for the project is June 2028.

The project is getting delayed when road safety issue has become a major concern as thousands of people are getting killed or maimed every year. The issue came to the fore again after a bus, which had no fitness clearance, veered off the Dhaka-Bhanga expressway and crashed, killing 19 people last month.

Contacted, Road Transport and Highways Division Secretary ABM Amin Ullah Nuri said the project proposal is now with the Planning Commission and its approval is expected soon.

In reply to a query, he told The Daily Star last night, ""There is no risk over getting the fund. The project will be approved within the timeline.""

THE PROJECT

The World Bank, in its appraisal report prepared for financing a road safety project in Bangladesh in 2021, said different bodies exist in Bangladesh to ensure road safety, but they are not empowered and lack effective coordination to get expected outcomes.

These organisations are also not held accountable. Besides, the fund allocated for road safety action plans is insufficient, not prioritised, and has never been institutionalised, it said.

The multi-lateral financer carried out several studies before taking the final decision regarding the loan.

Meanwhile, in September 2021, Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader at an event alleged that the WB was delaying its decision to finance Bangladesh's road safety project, despite repeatedly expressing interest.

The WB on August 28 last year approved $358 million loan to help Bangladesh improve road safety, and reduce fatalities and injuries from road accidents in selected high-risk highways and district roads.

The project will have several components and will be implemented by the RHD, Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, Directorate General of Health Services and Bangladesh Police.

It will pilot comprehensive road safety measures, including improved engineering designs, road signs and markings, pedestrian facilities, speed enforcement, and emergency care from Gazipur to Elenga and Natore-Nawabganj highways. These measures will help reduce road traffic deaths by more than 30 percent on these two highways, the WB hoped.

The project will also undertake road safety pilots in selected urban areas and district roads. It will improve post-crash care, which is critical in saving lives, and will also set up an ambulance service via a toll-free number and upgraded emergency care services in selected district hospitals, and upazila health complexes along the two national highway corridors.

DELAY IN PROJECT APPROVAL

Upon receiving the DPP, the Planning Commission in February 2022 asked project implementation agencies to recast it with the answer of more than 20 queries, said RHD sources.

In December last year, the DPP was re-submitted with an estimated cost of Tk 4,951.52 crore.

But the Planning Commission in March this year asked answers for 14 more quarries. RHD submitted the DPP to the Road Transport and Highways Division again late last month.

But the division raised some queries and the DPP was resent with all answers on Sunday, they said.

The project cost stood at Tk 4,988.14 crore now following an increase in US dollar rate. The WB is supposed to give Tk 3,759.82 crore in the project and the government is to provide Tk 1,228.32 crore, they added.

Involvement of three other agencies and the delay in getting necessary information to answer the queries are one of the major reasons for the delay, said a top RHD official.",https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/transport/news/biggest-road-safety-project-concern-rising-over-fate-wb-fund-3287986

When it comes to the frequency of road crashes in Bangladesh, things only seem to be going downhill. Last month, according to a just-released estimate by the Road Safety Foundation (RSF), 564 people died in 486 road crashes. This is quite similar to what the situation was a year ago, when the RSF reported the deaths of 589 people in 458 crashes, meaning that there has been no progress during this time. And if we take into account the 2022 casualties – 7,713 deaths in total – we can see that an average of 21 people die on our roads every day.

This is certainly not the kind of situation we want to see going into another Eid holiday in about two weeks.

Road crash data from two government agencies does not match and this could lead to problems in making informed decisions on road safety.

Until January this year, Bangladesh Road Transport Authority used Bangladesh Police's data on road crashes. But the BRTA started publishing its own accident data in January.

According to the BRTA, 636 people were killed and 752 others injured in 630 road accidents in January and February.

Police say 542 people were killed and 420 others injured in 557 road crashes during the same period.

This mismatch raised questions about the accuracy of both.

However, the numbers are much lower than that provided by NGOs working on road safety.

This could become a problem for the government as it is implementing the National Road Safety Strategic Action Plan-2021-2024 to reduce 20 to 25 percent casualties by 2024, and to halve the casualty number by 2030. This is a target of the Sustainable Development Goal.

Different international organisations have also raised questions about the accident data and data collection system.

""The current system of recording, analysing, and reporting crashes in Bangladesh is cumbersome, error-prone, time-consuming, and unfit for analysis and benchmarking,"" the World Bank observed in an appraisal report in 2021 prepared for financing a road safety project in Bangladesh.

Poor quality and unreliable data on crashes, deaths, and injuries impede proper road safety management. — The World Bank

""Poor quality and unreliable data on crashes, deaths, and injuries impede proper road safety management,"" said the WB.

At least 24,954 people were killed in road crashes in the country in 2016, according to a World Health Organisation report published in December 2018.

According to the police, 2,463 people were killed in 2,566 road crashes in 2016.

The WB has already approved a loan for a Tk 4,988.14 crore project on road safety. Under the project, among other works, a road accident database will be developed.

THE DIFFERENCES

According to the BRTA data, 333 people died in 322 road crashes in January while 303 were killed in 308 road accidents in February this year.

But the police report says 279 people were killed in 280 crashes in January while 263 people died in 277 road accidents this February.

Jatri Kalyan Samity, a passenger welfare platform, said 585 people were killed in 593 road accidents in January and at least 467 people died in 447 road crashes in February.

The organisation's data is based on newspaper reports. It said the number of crashes and deaths could be higher as many accidents go unreported while many die of injuries which too are not reported.

Contacted, BRTA Chairman Nur Mohammad Mazumder said they collected their data through their offices across the country and verified those with police and district administration data.

Asked about the mismatch with police data, he said police data is based on the cases filed over the accidents, but many injured died in hospitals later.

""We include the hospital data and that's why our number may be higher than that of police,"" he told The Daily Star yesterday.

""Definitely, we will use our data for official purposes and will evaluate our target on the basis of our data.""

This correspondent tried to contact police officials concerned for comments but could not reach them.

Saidur Rahman, executive director of Road Safety Foundation, said the government agencies should make better efforts for accurate data.

""In absence of real data, the authorities will not able to take proper preventive measures to reduce road crashes,"" he said yesterday.

At least three road safety campaign platforms in January this year published their reports saying that the number of both road crashes and deaths went up last year compared to 2021.

Road Transport and Highways Division Secretary ABM Amin Ullah Nuri at a programme on January 15 blasted the road safety campaigners for publishing ""fabricated"" reports on crashes.

Just 11 days after a blaze ripped through the Bangabazar shopping complex, another one yesterday gutted Dhaka New Super Market, causing losses to businesses and traders.

The back-to-back fires have brought forth concerns over safety regulations, as both the markets were marked ""risky"" by the Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defence. Both broke out during the month of Ramadan -- a peak time for businesses with the Eid-ul-Fitr coming up.

Add to that, the affected markets were among the top shopping destinations for people from the lower- and middle-income groups.

Around 5:40am yesterday, the fire service was informed about the blaze at Dhaka New Super Market.

Thirty units of firefighters rushed to the spot and managed to bring the flame under control after three and a half hours.

As of filing of this report around 8:00pm, they were still working at the site to douse the fire on the second floor of the market. However, no deaths were reported till then.

Maruf Hossain, convener of Dhaka New Super Market Beboshayee Samity (Dakshin), said that according to their primary assessment, around 500 shops were affected, of which 280 to 300 were completely burned down.

He added that products of around Tk 40-50 crore were sold every day during the last 10 days of Ramadan almost every year.

At least 29 people, including 14 firefighters, had fallen ill due to smoke inhalation, and were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for treatment.

Of them, 14 were admitted to the burn and plastic surgery institute for extreme smoke inhalation.

Speaking to The Daily Star, injured firefighter Taufiq Elahi said, ""We fell sick from the smoke and heat. We started watering and moved from the first to the second floor, where it was too hot and smoky.""

Shanto, another firefighter, said, ""I entered the second floor with an oxygen cylinder strapped on. At some point, the oxygen ran out and I fell sick. My colleagues had to rescue me and bring me to hospital.""

Though no valid information regarding the source of the fire was given yet, traders and eyewitnesses said it started on the second floor and then spread from there. Around 8:30am, the third floor was ablaze.

Brig Gen Md Main Uddin, director general of Fire Service and Civil Defence, said the fire came under control at 9:10am.

""But it will take more time for us to douse it completely. We are giving utmost priority to recovering the traders' goods.""

Asked if this fire, along with the previous ones, gives any hint of being ""subversive activities"", he said they would seek the assistance of the law enforcers for an investigation.

The DG, however, pointed out that such recurring incidents are mainly due to a lack of awareness.

Meanwhile, some traders of the market claimed the fire was caused by electrical works done on an adjoining footbridge before dawn.

THEY BRAVED HEAT, FIRE... Colleagues help a firefighter suffering from exhaustion at the Dhaka New Super Market yesterday morning. Photo: Collected, Rashed Shumon

Visiting the spot, Dhaka South City Corporation Mayor Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh said they are urging all intelligence agencies concerned to investigate if the fire was somehow an act of sabotage.

He also urged the media to play a responsible role in reporting whether the fire was part of any propaganda.

Terming the traders' claims baseless, DSCC spokesperson Md Abu Nasher said there was no scope to link the fire with the footbridge work.

Nasher, also public relations officer of the DSCC, said they had closed down the footbridge around a year ago because it was risky, but people continued to use it, and traders also set up stalls there.

Due to this, the DSCC appointed a contractor to work on separating the bridge from the first floor of the market on April 12. The work began around 2:00am yesterday and ended around 5:15am, he said, adding that the fire began around 10 minutes before 6:00am.

Nasher also said the spot of the fire was around 400 feet away from where the footbridge was being worked on, and no gas cutter was used there.

Dhaka Power Distribution Company officials were also present when the footbridge work was ongoing, he added.

On April 4, a fire broke out at the Bangabazar shopping complex, burning down around 3,000 shops and readymade garments.

Shop owners claimed that goods worth around Tk 1,000 crore were damaged.

Just a week after, on April 11, a fire broke out in a ceramics warehouse in the capital's Chawkbazar.

Then on April 13, a blaze in the capital's Nawabpur burnt down at least 20 warehouses.

POLICE SMELLS SABOTAGE

Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun, inspector general of police (IGP), yesterday warned they will take stern action against anyone found involved in the recent fire incidents.

""We have recently noticed that there have been fire incidents in several markets in the capital. Police are investigating every incident thoroughly.""

IGP Mamun made the remarks while addressing an Iftar and cash distribution ceremony for the poor and destitute, organised by the Bangladesh Shop Owners Association at the Shiddeshwari School and College ground.

He urged the association to extend a helping hand as many people have lost their jobs due to the fires.

Khandker Golam Faruq, commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, urged the same.

MARKED 'RISKY', NOTHING DONE

Along with Dhaka New Super Market and Bangabazar, many other markets -- Gausia, Mouchak, Rajdhani Super Market -- were all earlier identified and marked ""at risk of fire hazards"" by the Fire Service and Civil Defence, said Lt Col Mohammad Tajul Islam Chowdhury, its director (operation & maintenance).

On April 6, the fire service, along with the National Security Intelligence and Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, conducted a drive in the Gausia Market, next to Dhaka New Super Market, and announced it was risky.

Md Bazlur Rashid, assistant director of the fire service, during the drive said though there were some fire extinguishers there, proper fire safety systems were absent.

He pointed out that many staircases were blocked as goods were either kept right at the mouth of those or makeshift shops occupied the spaces. ""In any market, this could hamper smooth evacuation during fire incidents.""

A DSCC official yesterday told The Daily Star that during earlier drives, they repeatedly asked traders to make sure goods were not kept in front of the stores or in the lobbies of the markets.

Lt Col Md Rezaul Karim, director (training, planning and development) of the fire service, said that along with the sub-shops in the corridors, banners and posters are also hung all over inside the markets, which helps the fires spread.

He added, ""The fire has not yet been fully extinguished [till 9:40pm]. Twelve of our units are still working and will do so until it is completely put out.""

There was no continuous guardrail -- a major inconsistency and lacking for such an expensive and high-standard expressway.

The ARI revealed the information while disseminating the investigation findings at Buet's Council Bhaban.

It recommended conducting urgent Road Safety Audits on that corridor of the expressway to identify safety lapses and install a continuous safety barrier.

The institute also said 264 people were killed in 222 road accidents in nine months since June last year (almost one death every day) on this very expressway.

""This essentially suggests that only construction of high standard capital-intensive infrastructure is not enough to ensure safe mobility. There is a need for vehicles that are fit and expressway-worthy; competent drivers, standard road safety devices and, most importantly, well-enforced safe and disciplined traffic operating conditions,"" said Prof Shamsul Hoque, director of ARI.

""It would be highly regrettable if this 'proven-to-be safe' expressway gradually becomes hazardous and fails to improve the [road] safety situation in Bangladesh.""

After the Madaripur crash, a government probe committee said the registration of the Emad Paribahan bus had been suspended for involvement in accidents before and thus, was not eligible for plying highways, especially with its overspeeding being another plausible reason behind the accident.

Mainly, infrastructural deficiencies led to so many fatalities and severe injuries. Even though crashes can't be prevented, fatalities can be averted with very low-cost but highly effective countermeasures. — Prof Shamsul Hoque Director of Buet's Accident Research Institute

The driver did not have the licence for operating heavy vehicles and might have lost control over the wheel as the road was slippery after rain.

The ARI probe, however, nullified many of these findings.

It prepared a speed profile of the bus with the speed data available on the Akash TrackMe server as the bus had an Event Data Recorder.

From the data, the ARI found the bus was operating at a speed of 79kmph when the accident occurred, Prof Shamsul said.

""The driver was not speeding and had enough scope to take rest. So, speeding or tiredness are not likely to be the reasons behind the accident,"" he said, adding that the weather too was unlikely to be a factor.

The bus was registered with Bangladesh Road Transport Authority in 2018 but was later modified to increase the number of seats.

Meanwhile, the tyres were relatively new but of poor quality, and one was found punctured.

Shamsul said that in this given situation, a tyre burst could be the most plausible cause for the crash.

He said there was no protection on the road for derailed vehicles, adding that many fatalities could have been avoided if there were guardrails.

""Mainly, infrastructure deficiencies led to so many fatalities and severe injuries. Even though crashes can't be prevented, fatalities can be averted with very low-cost but highly effective countermeasures.""

Prof Shamsul further said drivers are always targeted after an accident. ""People at the top level should be held accountable instead.""

He said pre-safety audits should be made mandatory before opening a highway or expressway and imported tyres should be examined.

He also emphasised maintaining lane discipline to ensure road safety on the expressway.",https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/madaripur-road-crash-guardrail-couldve-saved-many-lives-3298496

THE shifting dynamics of vehicular traffic in our nation have resulted in a meteoric rise in the number of motorcycles licensed for use. Given the profound effect this trend has had on road safety, it is urgent that we take steps to reduce the incidence of motorcycle crashes and deaths. Safer roads for everyone may be achieved by investments in infrastructure, more enforcement of traffic laws, and increased awareness of safe riding practices among motorcyclists.

Motorcycles have become an increasingly popular mode of transport in our country. There are many reasons for this rise in popularity, including their affordability, fuel efficiency and ease of manoeuvrability in traffic. However, the increasing number of motorcycles on the road has had a significant impact on road safety. Motorcycles are known to be much riskier than four-wheelers due to their vulnerable features, and they are involved in a significant percentage of all road accidents.

According to data from the Road Transport Authority, motorcycles now account for almost 70 per cent of all registered vehicles in our country. This is a significant increase from less than a decade ago when motorcycles accounted for only 10 per cent of all registered motor vehicles. The number of registered motorcycles has also increased from 7,55,514 in 2010 to 40,90,143 in recent years. This rise in the number of registered motorcycles has led to a sharp increase in the number of motorcycle accidents and fatalities. It is essential to address this issue by implementing effective measures to improve road safety and reduce the number of motorcycle accidents.

Motorcycles are known to be riskier than cars because they offer less protection to the rider. This makes motorcyclists more vulnerable to injuries and fatalities in the event of an accident. Furthermore, motorcycles are more prone to accidents due to their size, which makes them less visible to other drivers on the road. In addition, motorcyclists are, as studies show, more likely to violate traffic rules, including reckless driving, over-speeding, and not wearing proper protective equipment, which contributes to the problem of motorcycle accidents. The use of protective gear is essential in reducing fatalities and injuries in motorcycle accidents. According to a study by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, helmets reduce the risk of head injuries by 69 per cent and the risk of death by 37 per cent. In addition to helmets, motorcyclists should also use other protective gear, such as gloves, jackets, and boots. The use of protective gear can significantly reduce the severity of injuries sustained in motorcycle accidents.

The increasing number of registered motorcycles has also put pressure on existing infrastructure, including roads and highways. Many roads are not designed to accommodate large numbers of motorcycles, which can cause congestion and increase the risk of accidents. To address the problem of motorcycle accidents, it is essential to take measures to improve road safety. This can include the development of new infrastructure that is designed to accommodate motorcycles, such as dedicated motorcycle lanes.

Additionally, measures must be taken to enforce traffic rules and regulations effectively, including imposing penalties on motorcyclists who violate traffic rules. Moreover, it is essential to educate motorcyclists on safe driving habits and the importance of wearing proper protective gear.

The inadequacy of current traffic laws and regulations is a significant factor contributing to the rise in motorcycle accidents and fatalities. While there are laws in place that mandate the use of helmets and other protective gear for motorcyclists, these laws are often not enforced effectively. Furthermore, there are few laws that address issues specific to motorcycles, such as lane splitting and filtering. A study by the World Health Organisation found that only 26 countries have comprehensive motorcycle safety policies in place, indicating the need for improvements in road safety regulations.

Improving safety measures on roads and highways can also play a critical role in reducing motorcycle accidents. This can include measures such as improved lighting, better road markings and reducing road hazards such as potholes. In addition, the use of crash barriers and other protective barriers can also reduce the severity of injuries sustained in motorcycle accidents. Stricter enforcement of traffic rules and regulations is critical in addressing the problem of motorcycle accidents.

A study found that enforcement of traffic rules is one of the most effective ways to reduce road accidents. Law enforcement agencies must ensure that motorcyclists who violate traffic rules are penalised appropriately. The government also has a critical role to play in reducing motorcycle accidents and fatalities. The government must review and update current traffic laws and regulations to make them more effective in reducing motorcycle accidents and fatalities. In addition, the government should allocate resources towards improving road infrastructure, including dedicated motorcycle lanes and improving visibility on roads. According to a study by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, the implementation of dedicated motorcycle lanes can reduce the number of motorcycle accidents by up to 50 per cent.

Public education and awareness campaigns can also play a crucial role in reducing motorcycle accidents and fatalities. These campaigns can be used to educate motorcyclists on the importance of following traffic rules and regulations, wearing proper protective gear and using caution on the road. In addition, public awareness campaigns can be used to encourage other road users, such as car and truck drivers, to be more aware of motorcyclists on the road and to share the road safely. To be effective, these campaigns must be tailored to the specific needs of motorcyclists and other road users. This requires a comprehensive approach that involves collaboration between government agencies, civil society organisations, and other stakeholders.

Hence, the role of law enforcement and government policies is crucial in addressing the problem of motorcycle accidents and fatalities. Stricter enforcement of traffic rules and regulations, updates to current traffic laws and regulations, and public education and awareness campaigns are all critical components of a comprehensive approach to road safety. By working together, law enforcement agencies, government officials, and other stakeholders can help reduce the number of motorcycle accidents and fatalities and create safer roads for all.

2023-04-25,"['munshiganj', 'natore', 'dinajpur']",[1.0],[688.0],[],[],[],N/A,"Eid vacations in Bangladesh are a time of joy and celebration with family, but it can also quickly take a turn for the worse owing to the risky journey back home. With one of the highest road accident rates globally, Bangladesh's roads are deadly and the situation only worsens during the Eid holidays.

On Thursday, April 20, three separate road accidents took place in Dinajpur, Munshiganj, and Natore districts. These accidents claimed the lives of at least nine individuals, including three members of the same family. Additionally, 20 other individuals were reported to have suffered injuries. The incidents are a stark reminder of the dangers of road accidents during Eid holidays.

The grim reality of unexpected deaths on roads is akin to a pandemic in our country. With each passing day, the severity of the situation appears to be worsening, as more and more people are losing their lives.

In January, the Bangladesh Passengers' Welfare Association released a report that showed 6,749 road accidents took place in Bangladesh in 2022, leading to the devastating loss of 9,951 lives and injuring 12,356 others. What is even more alarming is that the number of road accidents increased by 18.89% and fatalities by 27.43% in 2022 compared to 2021.

The month of March this year saw a total of 415 lives lost and 688 individuals injured in road accidents, as reported by the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority. The frequency of such incidents is especially concerning during festive occasions such as Eid.

Looking back, the deaths of two students in 2018, caused by an unlicensed driver driving recklessly, triggered nationwide protests led by school and college students. The protests demanded safety on roads, including stricter enforcement of traffic rules and regulations and addressing other irregularities on roads and highways. However, despite the government's promises to bring discipline on the streets, little change has been seen in the years since.

The budget for communication infrastructure has been raised annually over the past few decades. According to the proposed national budget for 2022-23, the transport and communication sector will receive Tk 81,518 crore, an increase from Tk 72,029 crore allocated in the current financial year 2021-2022, as announced by the finance minister.

Despite significant spending, corruption within responsible departments has left the communication infrastructure sector in shambles. Many roads and highways in the country have been poorly constructed at exorbitant costs by politically backed contractors with no accountability. As a result, Bangladesh ranked one of the worst in Asia for road communication infrastructure.

The corrupt actions of some officials of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) also adds to the miseries. According to recent reports by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), the BRTA is one of the most corrupt agencies in the country. Vehicle owners and drivers are required to pay for services such as vehicle registration, route permits, transfer of ownership, and issuance of driving licenses. Shockingly, around 61 percent of drivers obtain their driving licenses without undergoing driving tests. They simply pay a bribe to BRTA personnel or brokers for the paperwork.

The corruption that allows untrained drivers and unfit vehicles to operate on the roads contributes significantly to the increasing rate of accidents. Additionally, the lack of awareness of traffic rules among drivers, their lack of proficiency, and the poor state of vehicles on the roads all play a role. This situation is exacerbated by the reckless and indifferent behaviour of commercial vehicle owners and transport workers, who are influenced by politics, corruption, mismanagement, and poor policies. As a result, the chaos on the roads continues, and middle- and low-income people who rely on public transport suffer endlessly.

While accidents can never be completely eliminated, they should be the exception, not the norm.

We should also consider the impact of these unexpected deaths on the surviving family members. The emotional and financial toll is immeasurable, and the trauma is long-lasting. It is not just loss of a loved one, but also a loss of dreams, and aspirations that can never be reclaimed. Unless the government takes decisive action to address these issues, innocent lives will continue to be lost on our dangerous roads.

As Bangladesh looks to take the next step in its development journey, citizens have the right to expect safe roads. Authorities must ensure that people can enjoy the festivities of Eid, without the fear of losing their lives in the mad rush to get home. While accidents can never be completely eliminated, they should be the exception, not the norm. As the holidays come to an end and people slowly start returning to the capital, let us all hope that we do not have to read more about fatal accidents.

A semi-trailer truck and a bus carrying elderly people collided in central Canada’s Manitoba province on Thursday, killing at least 15 people and injuring 10 more, authorities said.

Canadian police said on Twitter that officers were responding to a ‘mass casualty collision’ near the town of Carberry, west of Winnipeg, and that first responders and other Royal Canadian Mounted Police units were on the scene.

‘What I can confirm right now is that a bus carrying approximately 25 people collided with a semi at the intersection of Highway One and Highway Five,’ RCMP Manitoba officer Rob Hill told reporters, adding most of the people in the minibus were elderly.

‘Fifteen people have been confirmed deceased,’ while 10 others were transported to hospital with various injuries, he said.

Hospitals in the region confirmed they were responding to large numbers of victims and that all facilities were on alert.

The crash occurred on the Trans-Canada Highway north of Carberry.

Several tarps were laid on the ground, apparently covering some of the victims, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which said witnesses described a burned vehicle in a ditch near the highway.

According to Nirmesh Vadera, who works near the accident site in a roadside hotel restaurant, numerous emergency vehicles and two helicopters were at the scene of the crash, which occurred around midday.

‘It was really, really surreal to see the extent of (the accident), because I’ve never seen this kind of fire on any vehicle,’ Vadera told AFP by telephone, adding there was lots of smoke visible around the site and dozens of emergency responders were on the scene.

‘The news from Carberry, Manitoba is incredibly tragic,’ Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on his official Twitter feed, adding he was sending his ‘deepest condolences’ to those who lost loved ones.

‘I can’t imagine the pain you’re feeling, but Canadians are here for you,’ he said.

‘My heart breaks hearing the news of the tragic accident near Carberry. My most sincere condolences go out to all those involved,’ tweeted Manitoba’s premier Heather Stefanson.

She said flags at the province’s legislative building have been lowered to half-staff ‘out of respect for those we have tragically lost.’

Authorities said the highway was closed in both directions and they were asking motorists to avoid the area.

‘There were people all over the place, some looked like they were getting medical attention,’ truck driver Josh Carson, who had driven past the accident site, told Global News television.

‘It for sure looked like a pretty bad one.’

The Road Safety Project, which receives $358 million in financing from the World Bank, is the first dedicated road safety project in South Asia supported by the World Bank.

On two national highways — N4 (Gazipur-Elenga) and N6 (Natore to Nawabganj) — the project will pilot comprehensive road safety measures, including improved engineering designs, signage and marking, pedestrian facilities, speed enforcement, and emergency care.

These measures will help reduce road traffic deaths by more than 30 per cent on these two highways.

To make the highways and urban roads safer, in five divisions — Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Mymensingh — the project will install road signs, dividers, footpaths, raised zebra crossings, speed breakers, and bus bays.

‘Road safety affects us all. Road crashes are the fourth leading cause of children’s death in Bangladesh, and youth are disproportionately affected. Road fatalities and injuries are personal and family tragedies, and they undermine a country’s growth and human development. For Bangladesh, improving road safety is a key development priority,’ said Abdoulaye Seck, World Bank country director for Bangladesh and Bhutan.

‘Through this project and other ongoing initiatives, the World Bank is helping Bangladesh make roads safer for its people.’

Fast access to medical facilities and trauma care is crucial in saving lives from road crashes. The project will pilot ambulance services, including bike-ambulances, with a toll-free number to take road crash victims to the hospital quickly along selected highways and roads. Further, the project will upgrade trauma care facilities in selected district hospitals, and Upazila Health Complexes.

Road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader, who was present as the chief guest, said, ‘The project will support Bangladesh in its commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals on road safety by 2030.’

The project will help modernise the capacity of the traffic police and highway patrol to manage speeding and prevent risky road user behaviour.

To control speed, the project will install CCTV on roads, and construct electric messaging system. It will make provision for patrol vehicles and crash site cleaning equipment.

It will also help the government strengthen institutions to effectively manage road safety across the country.

The Roads and Highways Department, Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, Bangladesh Police, Directorate General of Health Services of the government of Bangladesh will work together to implement the project.

More than one in five buses of private operators running in the capital have no valid fitness certificates.

According to the data from the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, 3,974 buses of 75 companies have the required route permits for operating in Dhaka city, but 871 of the buses, 21.92 percent, do not have fitness clearances.

The Daily Star has obtained a document, containing the data, that was placed before a meeting at the headquarters of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) on May 5 where many bus owners were present.

In reality, over 120 operators run more than 5,000 buses in the capital. And many of the vehicles do not have route permits and they ply the city streets allegedly by bribing, say transport sector insiders.

On October 13 last year, Dhaka South City Corporation Mayor Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh said over 1,600 unauthorised buses were operating in the city despite an ongoing drive against such buses.

The issue of unauthorised buses was discussed last month at the meeting of the coordination committee tasked with bus route rationalisation and operating buses under companies.

The government in 2019 formed a committee to rationalise bus routes and have a limited number of bus service providers. So far it has managed to launch the system in three of the 42 reshaped routes.

Member secretary of the committee, Shabiha Pervin, also executive director of Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority, said Hanif Paribahan, which was supposed to operate on route-23, expressed disinterest as many unauthorised buses were running there, meeting minutes show.

Route-23 starts from Ghatarchar and ends at Chattogram Road via Shyamoli, College Gate, Asad Gate, Kalabagan, Science Lab, Shahbagh, Jatiya Press Club, Gulistan, Dainik Bangla, Kamalapur, Dhalpur, Jatrabari, Shanir Akhra, Rayerbagh, Matuail, and Signboard.

Transport expert Prof Hadiuzzaman said unfit vehicles are risky for other fit vehicles too.

The former director of the Accident Research Institute at Buet said pedestrians in Dhaka are more vulnerable and such unfit vehicles increase their risk. The vehicles are causing serious environmental pollution, he told The Daily Star yesterday.

He said drivers of unauthorised vehicles know that they have a strong clout that allows them to run illegal vehicles and that is why they drive vehicles more recklessly.

Khondaker Enayet Ullah, general secretary of the Dhaka Road Transport Owners' Association, admitted that there were buses on the streets without fitness certificates.

""But how will the association know which buses have no fitness clearances? The BRTA has the data and it can take action against those,"" he told this newspaper.

He said owners of some 1,500 buses sought route permits a few years ago and the regional transport committee had even recommended the permits be issued.

But the coordination committee in 2019 decided not to issue route permits anymore, which made the 1,500 buses illegal, he said.

He refused to comment on the allegation that the illegal buses were running by paying bribes.

Most city buses operate on ""trip system"", in which the owners receive a certain amount of money for a set number of trips the drivers make. The drivers and their helpers get to keep all money earned from any trips beyond the set number. This system promotes racing on the streets, one bus cutting off another, buses blocking streets to prevent being overtaken by another bus, and picking up of passengers here and there, experts said.

This is why transport experts had recommended rationalisation of bus routes and bringing all public buses under a fixed number of companies for better regulation.

Late DNCC Mayor Annisul Huq had taken the initiative. Later, the government in September 2018 formed a committee, led by the DSCC mayor, to introduce the system and rationalise the routes.

The authorities preliminarily decided to have 22 companies running 42 routes.

On December 26, 2021, the new system was launched with Nagar Paribahan on one route. In October last year, Nagar Paribahan started operating on two more routes.

Asked about the slow implementation progress, Prof Hadiuzzaman said it would complicate the situation further. As the issuance of route permits to new buses has been suspended for a long time, the slow implementation will deteriorate the public transport crisis, he added.

Contacted, BRTA Chairman Nur Mohammad Mazumder said their mobile courts and police would take action against those buses running without fitness clearances.

Asked about the unauthorised buses, he told this correspondent yesterday that those will be impounded after drives.

According to official data, Bangladesh has one of the highest mortality rates attributed to road accidents globally,

The data also shows that the primary cause of these accidents are shoddy highways, negligently maintained vehicles, violation of traffic regulations by drivers, and lack of surveillance on behalf of the traffic department.

Road safety experts and highway police observed that most fatal accident victims were from poor backgrounds.

The Road Transport Act 2018 banned carrying people as passengers on goods vehicles, making it a punishable offence under Section 92 of the law.

But experts said that the provision had rarely been enforced, and as a result, the number of such accidents had increased.

Carrying people as passengers on trucks, pickup vans, and other goods vehicles is common, particularly during festival times such as Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Azha.

Most recently, on Sunday, four people, including three students, were killed and 15 were injured when the pickup van carrying them collided with a covered van on the Dhaka-Chattogram national highway around 4:30pm at Lalbagh area under Sadar Dakshin upazila in Cumilla.

The pickup van was carrying a group of 20–25 youth players who were to participate in a local football match. On June 7, a Sylhet city-bound potato-laden truck collided head-on with a pick-up van on the Dhaka-Sylhet national highway at about 5:30am at Kutubpur village in Nazirbazar area under the Dakshin Surma upazila, leaving 15 construction workers dead and 14 injured.

The workers were travelling to their workplace at Goalabazar in Osmani Nagar upazila in a pickup van.

Earlier on May 27, three women were killed and 10 others injured in a collision between a truck and a pickup van on the Dhaka-Sylhet national highway in the Mouchak area under Bahubal upazila in Habiganj.

All of the victims travelled in a pickup van.

Accident Research Institute director Md Shamsul Hoque told New Age on Sunday that a lack of monitoring and control led to fatal road accidents related to goods vehicles carrying passengers.

‘On these vehicles, the degree of exposure to fatalities during accidents is high as these are not designed to carry passengers,’ he said, adding that even some of these vehicles were improvised.

While examining the pickup van involved in the Nazirbazar d, Shamsul Hoque said that the vehicle was modified, defying the law.

‘Though the van has registration, I don’t know how this vehicle could run on roads with modifications,’ he said.

Shamsul Hoque, who teaches at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, said that many people, especially the poor, choose these vehicles to save money.

‘The number of road accidents will keep increasing unless law enforcers take proper action,’ he said.

In May, out of 394 fatal road accidents, around 13 per cent involved trucks and covered vans, according to a report of the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority.

According to the Road Safety Foundation, in May, out of the total vehicles involved in road accidents, the highest 29.2 per cent, were trucks, covered and pickup vans, and other goods vehicles, and 36 people inside these vehicles were killed in crashes.

In 2022, out of the total vehicles involved in road crashes, 25.4 per cent were trucks, covered and pickup vans, and other goods vehicles, and 453 people inside these vehicles were killed in crashes, as per the foundation.

AI Mahbub Uddin Ahmed, a supernumerary professor of sociology at Dhaka University and the chairman of the non-governmental organisation Road Safety Foundation, said that these crashes were taking place due to the absence of monitoring by law enforcement agencies.

Sometimes law enforcement agencies also take bribes from these vehicles’ drivers to let them carry passengers illegally, he said.

Politicians and members of law enforcement agencies often own such vehicles, which prevents action against them, he said.

Highway police superintendent for Sylhet, Mohammad Shahidullah, claimed on Sunday that the two recent fatal crashes in the Sylhet region were ‘rare incidents’.

‘This tendency is higher in the northern parts of the country,’ he told New Age, adding, ‘In the Sylhet region, most people have better financial situations, and that’s why they don’t look for cheaper means of transport.’

He said that on June 7, ill-fated construction workers hired the pickup from the Ambarkhana area inside the Sylhet metropolitan area to save money.

The crash took place inside the metropolitan area before reaching the highway, Shahidullah continued.

About the May 27 incident, he said that the passengers got on the pickup van from Kishoreganj and hid by using a cover over them.

‘We also have limitations as we don’t have police at all points on the highways,’ he said.

He claimed that they never allowed goods vehicles to carry passengers on highways and that they conducted regular drives.

Sylhet Metropolitan Police additional deputy commissioner [traffic] Gautam Deb told New Age on Monday that the June 7 crash took place in the early morning when traffic police were not deployed.

Television images showed scenes of devastation at the site of the crash, with the mangled wreckage of several minibuses and the overturned truck as rescue workers hunted in darkness for people feared trapped.

""So far we can confirm 48 dead and we are suspecting one or two are still trapped under the truck,"" local police commander Geoffrey Mayek told AFP after the accident on the highway between the towns of Kericho and Nakuru at around 6:30 pm (1530 GMT).

He said another 30 people had been seriously injured and rushed to various hospitals, warning that the toll could rise.

""I have seen a very bad scene, bodies and blood all over. So many people are dead,"" said one witness, Maureen Jepkoech.

Tom Mboya Odero, the regional police commander for the Rift Valley, said the truck travelling towards Kericho ""lost control and rammed into eight vehicles, several motorcycles, people who were by the roadside, vendors, and other people who were on other businesses"".

Kenyan leaders including President William Ruto expressed their condolences after the accident, which took place at a busy area known as Londiani junction.

Transport Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said on Twitter that the rescue efforts would be followed by investigations to determine the cause of the crash.

Collins Kipkoech, a senior doctor at Kericho County Hospital, said his facility's morgue had so far received 45 bodies while more victims were taken to other hospitals ""and the rescue is still ongoing"".

The Kenyan Red Cross, which sent ambulances and rescue workers to the scene, said heavy rains were hindering rescue operations.

""The truck was on high speed and it was hooting. It tried to avoid several vehicles before it came straight into the market,"" said witness Jepkoech.

""All I can say is that I am lucky to be alive because I saw what happened and I am alive because I ran, I am just lucky,"" she added.



- 'Happened in a flash' -

Another witness, Joel Rotich, said: ""The accident happened in a flash, many of them had no time to escape.

""There was a lot of confusion because people were screaming all over and everyone was running after the accident,"" he added.

""It took some time before people gathered courage and started helping those injured.""

According to figures from Kenya's National Transport and Safety Authority, at least 21,760 people were involved in road accidents last year, including 4,690 who died.

In a speech in December, Murkomen blamed human error for much of the carnage on the roads, including drunk or reckless driving, speeding and dangerous overtaking among other reasons for crashes.

Figures for the first three months of 2023 showed a slight reduction in fatalities to 974, which the NTSA attributed to a government awareness programme.

""My heart goes out to the families who have just lost their loved ones,"" he said, adding that ambulances had been mobilised and all health facilities were on standby.

Ruto, for his part, said the country was mourning with the families who had lost their loved ones. He urged motorists to be extra cautious on the roads particularly when there was heavy rain.

Images from the scene showed the mangled wreckage of the vehicle lying on its side at the bottom of a steep cliff as rescuers worked nearby.

Fifteen women died, two of them while receiving hospital care, as well as 13 men and a child, the prosecutor said.

The first official report set the number of fatalities at 27 and the number of wounded at 17.

An investigation has been launched into the cause of the accident, with early indications suggesting mechanical failure.

At least six of the injured were unconscious and in serious condition when they were rushed to hospital, according to the civil protection agency.

The bus, operated by a local transport company, had left the capital Mexico City on Tuesday night and was heading for the town of Santiago de Yosondua, authorities said.

""The driver of the vehicle presumably lost control... and unfortunately it fell into a ravine more than 25 meters (80 feet) deep,"" a state official, Jesus Romero, told a press conference.

The company operating the bus provides a daily service from Mexico City, he said.

Injured passengers were transferred to area hospitals, while emergency services retrieved the bodies of those killed, Romero added.

The accident happened in Magdalena Penasco, a town located in a mountainous area home to remote communities, winding roads and steep ravines.

""We deeply regret the accident that occurred in Magdalena Penasco,"" Oaxaca state governor Salomon Jara wrote on social media, offering condolences to the families of the deceased.

""Our government personnel are already working on the rescue operation and to provide all the support to the injured people,"" he said.

- Deadly accidents common -

Deadly road accidents are common in Mexico, usually due to high speeds, poor vehicle conditions or driver fatigue.

Many people rely on buses, sometimes operated by small transportation companies serving remote communities with aging vehicles.

Crashes involving freight trucks have also increased on the country's highways.

On Wednesday, a fiery smash involving cargo vehicles left eight people injured on a highway in the central state of Queretaro, authorities said.

In May, at least 18 Mexican tourists died when their bus plunged into a ravine in the western state of Nayarit.

The same month, 13 people were killed when a passenger van and a semi-truck collided on a highway in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas.

On 7 April, Bangladesh began receiving electricity from India's Adani Group on a commercial basis under a 25-year power purchase agreement from unit-1 of the Adani Godda 1,600MW thermal plant.

The first unit of the Godda plant has the capacity to generate around 750MW of electricity, but the plant is currently ready to supply around 660MW, according to sources.

A fault in the transmission line, following Cyclone Mocha, disrupted supply on 7 June.

Earlier on 9 March, the first unit of Adani's Godda 1,600MW Thermal Power Plant was synchronised with the transmission line of the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh.

The Adani Group faced controversy when it requested a power supply order from Bangladesh, which BPDB officials found to be unusually high compared to the cost of coal with the same heating value used in the Payra 1,320MW Thermal Power Plant built in Patuakhali of Barishal.

In a statement issued on 2 April this year, Adani Bangladesh officials, however, refuted the claims, stating that the cost of their power plant electricity would not be higher than that of other coal plants in Bangladesh, including Payra, Rampal, and Matarbari thermal power plants.

Local and international energy think tanks, including the Center for Policy Dialogue and the USA-based Institute of Energy and Economic Financial Analysis (IEEFA), however, found that the cost of the Adani Power Plant will be an expensive source for Bangladesh.

The tariff for power sold from the Godda plant to the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) will be almost double the initial expectation, notes a report released on 13 December 2022 from its Australian office.

Bangladesh is importing 1,160MW of electricity from India's eastern and western regions through two cross-border lines.

The report was published on Friday (14 July) after analysing accident reports published in nine national dailies, and seven online portals and electronic media from 23 June to 7 July.

During the festival, 106 people were killed in 117 road accidents involving truck, pickup and covered van which is 32.71% of the total accidents, the report said.

Among other vehicles involved in deaths from accidents, 7.4% were trucks, pickups, covered vans and lorries, 2.77% bicycles and rickshaws, 3.08% buses, 7.71% cars, microbuses and jeeps, and 21.6% three-wheelers and CNG-run auto-rickshaws.

Of the accidents, 43.23% occurred on national highways, 37.95% on regional roads and 12.21% on other roads, with 6.6% of those in the capital.

According to the findings of RSF, the number of deaths from road accidents came down by 16.63% compared to last year during the Eid-ul-Azha holidays, as law enforcers were more active this year.

ALGIERS, July 19 (AFP): At least 34 people were killed when an Algerian passenger bus collided head-on with a commercial vehicle and burst into flames in the country's southern desert Wednesday, officials said.

One of the North African country's deadliest road crashes in years also left 12 others injured, many with burn wounds, Algeria's civil defence agency said.

Unverified media images showed the mangled and charred hull of the bus after the accident which occurred at around 4:00 am (0300 GMT) near Tamanrasset, about a 2,000-kilometre (1,250 miles) drive south from the capital Algiers.

Local media reported burnt bodies were recovered from the bus wreck, near the town of Outoul, 20 kilometres west of Tamanrasset, deep in the Sahara.

The civil defence agency said the bus was carrying passengers between Tamanrasset and Adrar, a town of about 2,000 residents to the northwest.

Footage broadcast by local media showed the bus going up in a massive ball of flames.

Other images shared by Algerian media show rescuers at the scene, near the two burnt vehicles that were involved in the accident.

Authorities did not immediately elaborate on the circumstances of the deadly crash or what had caused it. Speed is the main cause of road accidents in the country, according to a government road safety agency.

There was no official comment on the accident. Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune is currently in China for a state visit.

Mohamed Boudraa, the governor-or wali-of Tamanrasset, visited the local hospital where the 12 injured were being treated, the official APS news agency reported. It said they suffered serious burns.

Provincial officials also arrived at the site of the accident to oversee rescue operations, APS said. Algeria recorded nearly 23,000 road accidents in 2022, leaving 3,409 people dead and more than 30,000 injured, according to the country's road safety chief Nacef Abdelhakim.",https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/world/algeria-bus-crash-claims-34-lives-1689784346

2023-07-22,['jatrabari'],1,[],[],[],"['bus', 'motorbike']",vehicle-vehicle,"Road accidents with mounting toll of deaths hardly draw the attention of newspaper readers or TV viewers. Deaths on road are being gradually accepted as something normal. But the shock that the near and dear ones of the victims of fatal road accidents suffer is beyond the comprehension of those who might give a fleeting glance at the reports or the video clips of the scene of accident or the dead.

As for instance, the death of a supreme court lawyer, Parvin Sultana, on Sunday (July 16) in a road accident in which the motorbike she was riding with her relative, Sakhawat, was knocked down by a bus on the Mayor Muhammad Hanif Flyover near Jatrabari, may not have hit headlines. But her death was devastating, most unexpected and unacceptable to her family members, friends, colleagues and those who cared about her. But it was all over in the blink of an eye.

Human life is now something expendable in the eyes of the mindless road traffic operators. Of late, frequency of road mishaps and the deaths attendant on them have risen alarmingly. After the wars and pestilence, it is perhaps the highways, and the Bangladeshi ones, to be more specific, should now hold the third place as the biggest killers around. In the past, more men than women would die in road mishaps. Now with more women travelling on the roads and highways, the reckless traffic appears to have taken a liking to women, even their children, as their numbers as casualties on the highways attributable to road accidents are gradually on the rise. Let us have a look at the July 15 report on road mishap-related deaths published in this paper. Considering the pattern of deaths, it seems, they have a temporal bias. For when it comes to the statistics on the fatalities involving children, their number is shown to have increased by 16.6 per cent in the second quarter (April-June) of the current year (2023) when compared with the figures for the same period in the previous year (2022). On the contrary, fewer women died in highway accidents (a decrease by 8.53 per cent) during the second quarter of this year compared to the death figure in the first quarter. The report was originally prepared by an organisation styled, Shipping and Communication Reporters Forum (SCRF).The good news, according to the report, is that the fatalities due to the dreaded motorbikes have reduced by around 12 per cent. The number of accidents involving motorcycles have increased, though, by more than five per cent.

As further highlighted by the report, in the six months till June this year, some 455 children and 404 women lost their lives in road accidents across the country. Clearly, the country's highways and vehicles that run on them are not at all safe for women and children. The road transports are not safe not only due to their being accident-prone, but also for their operators being hostile towards them. But why so many children had to die in accidents involving road transport within a span of six months? By all accounts, the number is high. Mortality figures on children and women, if infectious diseases are not the cause of the deaths, are an indicator of a society's attitude towards them. How is our position in that respect? Do the figures on the death of so many women and children in the road accidents reveal anything of substance about Bangladesh society?

Those conducting researches on road accidents should look into the issue.

The Barishal-bound bus of Bashar Smriti Paribahan, which started from Pirojpur’s Bhandaria upazila, fell into the roadside pond on the Barishal-Khulna highway around 10:00am yesterday, leaving 17 passengers dead and 35 others injured.

Indiscipline continues to reign supreme on the roads, taking a heavy toll on lives and properties, as the government's steps to address the malaise remain perfunctory, experts said.

The issue reared its ugly head again yesterday after a ""negligently driven"" Barishal-bound bus veered off the road and fell into a waterbody in Jhalakathi Sadar upazila -- claiming 17 lives and injuring 35.

Before this accident, there were 2,865 road crashes this year until Friday, killing 2,737 and injuring 4,201, according to data from the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority.

The actual number of fatalities is higher, according to reports from non-government organisations working for road safety.

""The accidents take place for overspeeding, overtaking and overconfidence,"" said Mozammel Haque, deputy inspector general (operation) of Highway Police.

Talking on the phone is another reason for the accidents; some use headphones to hoodwink law enforcers, he said.

""Roads will remain unsafe until proper enforcement of the law is ensured,"" said Ilias Kanchan, a prominent road safety crusader, referring to the Jhalakhati bus accident.

There is a serious lack of enforcement of the law by the Highway Police, said Moazzem Hossain, professor at Buet's department of civil engineering.

On his recent road trip to Barishal and Kuakata, he found the buses were going at a faster speed than his sports utility vehicle (SUV) on the highway. Heavy vehicles like buses and lorries are supposed to drive slower than light vehicles like cars or SUVs.

""The buses were overtaking everywhere -- they even got into speeding competitions on the expressway. They do this to get more passengers. This is dangerous and shows that there is no discipline on the road.""

The bus drivers do not have the necessary training too, said Hossain, also the former director of Buet's Accident Research Institute.

""All these are known facts. So, the authority cannot avoid their responsibility here.""

In recent times, the road infrastructure has gone through major upgrades but the driving population has not upgraded their skill accordingly.

""So the government cannot claim that they were ensuring the protection of people's lives.""

The government can deploy vehicle inspectors at every major bus terminal and check whether the bus has fitness or whether the driver has the necessary document before departing.

""This method can prevent road accidents but the authority is not interested,"" he added.

As many as 564,739 vehicles were due for regular fitness checks but did not take the clearance as of April 30, shows BRTA data. Of them, 20,362 were buses, 11,245 minibuses, 61,339 trucks and 6,767 taxicabs, shows the document.

Haque of Highway Police said it is not possible to stop the accidents only by enforcement.

""We are taking action and filling cases whenever any anomaly comes to notice. There is a need for raising road safety awareness. Drivers, as well as the passengers, need to stop rush driving,"" he said, adding that vehicles without fitness should be barred from roads.

Road accidents are taking place as people are driving faster for the smoother roads built by the government in recent times, said ABM Amin Ullah Nuri, secretary of road transport and highways division.

At least 17 people were killed and more than a dozen injured after a passenger bus veered off the road and rolled into a large roadside pond in southwestern Bangladesh on July 22.

“The accident took place in the Jhalakathi district when the bus carrying more than 60 passengers was on its way to Barishal, southwestern divisional headquarters, from Bhandaria sub-district,” police said. The vehicle fell into the pond after its driver lost control of the wheel.

“The divers have rescued 17 bodies and a police crane is trying to retrieve the bus from the pond filled with water after heavy monsoon rains,” a police officer told reporters.

Police sub-inspector Gautamm Kumar Ghose said the dead included eight women and three children. He feared more bodies could be found trapped inside the bus once the salvage campaign was completed. Twenty other passengers are being treated at the Jhalakathi’s main state-run hospital. It is believed that 65 passengers were inside the bus.

“I was sitting just beside the driver’s seat. The driver apparently was not careful or attentive while driving the bus,” said Russell Mollah, a 35-year passenger who was injured in the accident.

He said the driver was constantly talking to his assistant and asking him to get more passengers on board. Mr. Mollah lost his 75-year-old father in the accident while his elder brother is still missing.

The Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) took the initiative last May to restore the historic structure to its original grandeur.

This structure, once regarded as the gateway to Dhaka, can be found on the route from Bangla Academy to Doel Chattar in the Dhaka University area.

The Dhaka Gate stands as one of the oldest examples of Mughal architecture in the capital, and it holds a significant place in the city's past.

During the reign of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, Dhaka experienced significant growth, prompting Subahdar (governor) Mir Jumla to construct the gate as the northern entrance, marking the city's border.

The Dhaka Gate served as an entry point to the city from the bank of the Buriganga river. It played a crucial role in guarding the city from potential attacks by pirates.

Over the centuries, the Dhaka Gate endured severe damage, and it was rebuilt in 1825 by Magistrate Charles Dawes.

Currently located within the University of Dhaka campus near Curzon Hall and Shishu Academy, parts of the gate are at the Centre for Renewable Energy Research and the Mausoleum of three leaders.",https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/350-year-old-dhaka-gate-under-renovation-670318

We are concerned by a recent report of Centre for Government Studies (CGS) which found that at least 65 percent of 50 grassroots human rights defenders across 36 districts have faced obstructions in their work from the state and members of the ruling party. The report also found that one in five human rights defenders was harassed by law enforcement agencies and one in 10 by intelligence agencies. The methods of harassment include death threats, physical attacks, threats to family members and slapping of legal cases. The majority of respondents said the situation in the country was unsafe. Half of the respondents reported the harassment to the authorities, while the remaining respondents remained silent because they feared reprisal. In more than 40 percent of the cases, threats against them were not investigated either because of the state's involvement or because the perpetrators were connected to power. Three reported that they were victims of enforced disappearance because of their work.

While the sample size may not be very large, the survey findings are still significant. They provide an idea of how constrained human rights defenders are in doing their work and how vulnerable they are to various forms of harassment and intimidation. The report also notes how sometimes organisations' activities are curtailed by blocking access to foreign funds. Meanwhile, the Digital Security Act has been used arbitrarily to clamp down on human rights defenders.

These are disturbing developments in a democracy. As the elections approach, we apprehend that there will be more such attempts to intimidate human rights defenders. We urge the government to ensure their safety by instructing its law enforcement and intelligence agencies to stop harassing or intimidating them. As recommended by CGS, vague terms such as ""anti-state activities"", ""inimical"" and ""derogatory"" comments about the constitution and constitutional institutions that can be used to prosecute individuals must be removed from the Foreign Donations (Voluntary Activities) Regulation Act. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) must be reformed as an independent body with the capacity to investigate incidents of human rights violations and take effective action against violators, regardless of their affiliations.

Four districts and a seaport will join the country's rail network by October when 255km of rail lines are inaugurated.

This is the first time since the country became independent that rail lines of such huge length is being opened in one go, said officials of BR, the state-run transport agency.

The new lines -- three to be opened in full and one partially -- will not only boost Bangladesh Railway's capacity to carry goods and people but also improve regional trade.

The Chattogram-Cox's Bazar line will connect the beach town to the rest of the country via rail, the Dhaka-Mawa-Bhanga line will connect Munshiganj, Madaripur and Shariatpur to the capital, the Khulna-Mongla line will link the Mongla Port to the rest of the country and beyond. The Akhaura-Agartala line will increase regional trade and possibly people-to-people contact in future.

There would be 23 new stations on the new lines.

""It would be a giant leap for rail connectivity,"" Shahidul Islam, additional director general (infrastructure) of BR, told The Daily Star yesterday.

""We are hopeful of making all these four projects ready for opening by September,"" he said, adding, ""Opening of the lines will boost the railway's capacity significantly.""

However, all the projects saw cost and time overruns, a very common phenomenon for railway projects. None of the lines will be fully functional on day-1 as some of the work is yet to be completed, railway officials said.

The four rail projects require around 3,500 employees and none of them have been hired yet.

Bangladesh got 2,858km of rail lines when it achieved independence in 1971. The length of lines, instead of increasing, came down to 2,835km in 2009.

Currently 43 districts are under BR's 3,093.38km rail network.

The revival of BR mainly began after a separate rail ministry was formed in 2011.

Between 2008-09 and 2022-23 fiscal year, the government allocated Tk 1,07,645 crore for BR under the annual development programme (ADP).

However, BR could only spend Tk 71,113 crore, 66.06 percent of the allocation, until October last year.

CHATTOGRAM-COX'S BAZAR

The dual-gauge line from Chattogram to Cox's Bazar will connect the tourist town with the rest of the country by rail. Dhaka to Cox's Bazar train service is being planned.

The 102km line will have nine new stations. The Tk 18,034.47 crore fast-track project, funded by the ADB, is being implemented dividing the line into two parts -- Dohazari to Chakaria and Chakaria to Cox's Bazar.

""About 90 percent of the work of our portion is done and we aim to submit the work [to the authority] by September 30,"" Chen Yongyi, project manager of China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), told this correspondent.

CCECC, along with Max Infrastructure Ltd, is building the Chakaria to Cox's Bazar section.

During a recent visit to the Cox's Bazar station, this correspondent saw most of the work completed.

More than 80 percent of the work for the six-storey station is complete, Yongyi said.

Project Director Mofizur Rahman told this newspaper yesterday, ""The entire line will be ready by September and the authorities will decide when to open it.""

Sources said three of the nine new stations – Dohazari, Chakaria, and Cox's Bazar -- would be operational on day-1. The rest of the stations will be done by December.

The government in 2010 had decided to lay a metre-gauge rail line from Chattogram to Gundhum in Cox's Bazar spending Tk 1,852.35 crore. It later changed its mind and decided to have the dual-gauge line down to Cox's Bazar town. The cost shot up to Tk 18,034.47 crore.

Once the line is open, it will not only bring Cox's Bazar under rail network but also help connect Bangladesh with Trans-Asian Railway Network.

DHAKA-BHANGA

BR is implementing the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project to build 169km of rail line from Dhaka to Jashore via Padma Bridge, which will significantly improve rail connectivity with the southwest and even with India.

""We have a target to open the Dhaka-Bhanga section within September …,"" Project Director Afzal Hossain told this correspondent on July 13.

The length of Dhaka-Bhanga section is about 82km and the stretch will have seven new stations.

Of the seven new stations between Dhaka and Bhanga, Mawa, Padma (Janjira), and Shibchar stations would be ready for opening, Afzal said.

The rail line down to Jashore, via Narail, is expected to be complete by June next year at a cost of Tk 39,246.8 crore. It is being built with a loan from China.

This line will halve travel time to Jashore from Dhaka and Narail will have rail connectivity then.

KHULNA-MONGLA

The 63.5km broad-gauge rail line between Khulna and Mongla is expected to boost rail connectivity in Bangladesh and boost trade with India, Nepal and Bhutan.

""We hope to make the project ready for opening by mid-September,"" a project official said.

The line will have seven new stations.

Even though it was initiated in 2010, the physical work began around six years after approval, driving up the project cost to Tk 4,260.88 crore from Tk 1,721.39 crore.

The line is being built with an Indian line of credit.

AKHAURA-AGARTALA

The government in August 2016 approved the project for the dual-gauge line to improve rail connectivity and boost trade between Bangladesh and India.

The Tk 477.81 crore project to build the 7km line is being implemented with an Indian grant.

Once completed, it will connect Gangasagar in Bangladesh with Nischintapur in Tripura state of India.

The Khulna-Mongla and the Akhaura-Agartala rail lines are expected to be inaugurated during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India in September, Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma said recently.

Project Director Abu Jafor Mia told The Daily Star yesterday that initially freight trains would run on the line and if the countries decide, passenger trains could run.

Their demands included income tax exemption from the ambulances, adopting a national ambulance policy, toll exemption facility, parking facilities in the hospitals, priority service at the fuel stations, and harassment-free movement on the roads.

We are delighted by the increasing prospect of Japanese investors coming to Bangladesh. Over the years, the bilateral relation between the two countries has improved exponentially to the point where Japan is now one of our most integral partners. Last April, Japan's relationship with Bangladesh was upgraded to a ""strategic"" one from the previous comprehensive relationship, as recently emphasised by Japan's economy, trade and industry minister. As a number of Japanese companies are now looking to shift operations to various parts of Asia, the minister also said that Bangladesh has the potential to attract many of them, which would be a massive boon for investment here, and could lead to numerous added benefits such as increased job creations.

Japanese company Honda already opened its factory in Bangladesh some years ago. A Japanese information technology company, BJIT, has also started production in the country. We are, however, yet to see large-scale relocation of factories to Bangladesh, which will hopefully change once the Japan economic zone, being developed at Araihazar in Narayanganj, is complete. Additionally, the large-scale infrastructure development that has been happening in Bangladesh should inspire more foreign businesses to set up shop here to take advantage of Bangladesh's competitive advantages.

In 2022, Bangladesh received more than $100 million in investment from Japan, a record high, as the number of Japanese companies quadrupled in the country over the last decade. To take bilateral relations to the next level, both countries are now working to sign an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) to accelerate trade and investment. This, indeed, should be great news for all stakeholders.

However, in order to make the most of our growing economic and business relations, the Bangladesh government should conduct proper research and focus more on improving business conditions that can attract Japanese – and other – businesses to invest and conduct their manufacturing and operational activities out of Bangladesh. In terms of which sectors are showing the greatest promise, the Japanese side has already identified them. Now, it is up to our government to formulate policies in a way that can best compliment the growth of these sectors.

The decision by the Bangladesh government to set up a one-stop service centre for foreign businesses is expected to make life easier for them, and attract more of them. But there are still other ways for the government to further improve the overall business environment, and we hope that it will now shift its focus towards achieving those goals. But aside from the growing private investment, we hope to see even greater investment by the Japanese government in Bangladesh, so that the latter's goal of achieving rapid development and industrialisation can soon become a reality.",https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/bangladesh-japan-relations-the-right-track-3377471

The vehicle insurance business in Bangladesh is passing hard times as people are not interested in insuring automobiles in the absence of legal obligation as well as a lack of trust in insurers and promotional activities.

In the past, insurance was mandatory for all types of vehicles such as motorcycles, cars, buses and trucks. The government abolished the system in 2018, taking a toll on the insurance business.

Pioneer Insurance Company opened policies for 47,224 vehicles in 2020. It sharply fell to 11,747 in 2021 and 9,951 in 2022.

SM Mizanur Rahman, company secretary of the insurer, said when the government scrapped the law, people were not also giving much heed to the issue.

""If people don't buy vehicles on the basis of loans from banks or non-banks, very few of them would go for insurance. There are some corporate houses and compliant businesses that insure vehicles.""

Insurance is mandatory for vehicles purchased using loans.

According to Rahman, many people don't trust insurance companies due to various reasons. ""So, many don't insure their vehicles. If the government does not make it mandatory, the vehicle insurance business will lose its significance.""

When vehicle insurance was mandatory, a large part of a company's income used to come from the segment, said Md Sarfaraz Hossain, company secretary of Peoples Insurance Company.

The company earned Tk 16.20 crore in premiums from vehicle insurance in 2017 and this increased to Tk 19.46 crore in the following year before coming down to Tk 7.94 crore in 2022.

""People don't understand the importance of insurance. It's sad,"" he said.

Another blow for insurers came in 2020 when the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority abolished the motor third-party insurance, which is car insurance designed to protect the policyholder against the claims of other drivers in case of an accident.

In 2019, Reliance Insurance opened 40,000 third-party insurance policies and earned around Tk 20 crore as premiums.

After the abolishment of the rule, the number of policy openings fell to zero while premiums plummeted 50 percent, said Ramzanul Quadar Billah, vice-president of Reliance Insurance.

He blames the lack of awareness as one of the most notable factors for customers not buying motor insurance.

Mainly multinational companies and some local companies that have prioritised risk management are availing comprehensive motor insurance, Billah added.

Abdullah Al Maruf, a resident in the capital's Pallabi area, said he has been riding a motorcycle for the past several years without any insurance.

He did not purchase any policy despite the risks because of the confusion about whether he would get adequate support from the insurance company if he faces any accidents.

Ashrafuz Zaman, another resident in Dhaka, bought a private car four years ago but it hasn't been insured yet.

He is also confused like Maruf about whether he would reap any benefits if he purchases any policy.

""I have not seen many examples of people receiving benefits from insurance policies. Insurance companies also don't promote their products much.""

Shahidul Islam Zahid, a professor of banking and insurance at the University of Dhaka, said vehicle insurance is important as it helps policyholders reduce liabilities and pay for the damage caused during unfortunate incidents.

""Most people are not insuring their vehicles due to a lack of trust in most insurance companies. The companies can't avoid their responsibility.""

Prof Zahid added that there are conditions that prospective policyholders can't meet.

Recently, the government has moved to make insurance mandatory for vehicles again.

If not insured, owners will have to pay a fine of up to Tk 3,000 for each vehicle and if the law is not followed, police will file a case, according to the draft law.

An official of the Financial Institutions Division said a proposal to make insurance mandatory was sent to the finance ministry in April.

The division also sent a letter to the Road Transport and Highways Division in May, the official said, adding that the government loses revenue of Tk 878 crore every year since vehicle insurance is not mandatory.

The number of vehicles such as motorcycles, cars, buses and trucks that ply on the road in Bangladesh stood at 56,61,418 in February this year.",https://www.thedailystar.net/business/economy/news/vehicle-insurance-business-going-thru-tough-times-3380486

Though the country's road infrastructure saw much progress over the last decade, some of the major elements that could ensure road safety remain largely ignored, leaving roads still as anarchic and unsafe as ever before, experts and campaigners said.

They added that the main obstacle to bringing discipline on the roads is an ""unholy nexus among the political and influential groups that allow the anarchy to persist for years for their own benefits"".

As a result, too many people are still killed on the roads every day.

Against this backdrop, friends and families will observe today the death anniversary of Dia Khanam Mim and Abdul Karim Rajib, students of Shaheed Ramiz Uddin Cantonment College.

In 2018, the two students were killed after being run over by a speeding bus, which was racing with another, in the capital's Kurmitola, sparking an unprecedented movement across the country for safe roads.

Speaking to this correspondent yesterday, Dia's father Jahangir Fakir said, ""The situation hasn't changed much since then [2018]. We want the number of road crashes to come down significantly.""

The protests were able to provoke the authorities to take some actions.

In the face of demonstrations, the Road Transport Act-2018 was hastily passed in parliament and had clauses to ensure stringent punishments for traffic law violators, while the Prime Minister's Office issued 17 directives with regard to road safety.

The following year, a high-powered taskforce, headed by the home minister, was formed to curb road crashes and deaths.

However, relevant data shows that the situation has instead deteriorated.

According to media reports collected by Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, a passenger welfare platform, around 9,951 people were killed in 6,749 road crashes last year, while 7,221 were killed in 5,514 crashes in 2018.

Transport expert Prof Hadiuzzaman said the government has made major infrastructural progress in the transport sector and many roads have been expanded to four lanes.

""But there is no improvement in terms of reducing road crashes and deaths. The indiscipline on roads persists more than ever before,"" Hadiuzzman, also acting director of Accident Research Institute at Buet, told this newspaper yesterday.

The government has turned 717.75kms of roads into four or more lanes so far, and several projects are being implemented to expand 673.46kms of roads to four or more lanes, according the Road Transport and Highways Division.

Hadiuzzaman added that the government's focus was only on improving the infrastructure but the elements required for road safety were largely ignored.

He said there are ""five pillars"" for reducing road crashes -- safe roads; safe vehicles; safe users, including drivers, passengers and pedestrians; traffic management and post-accident management.

""Though we would not be able to fully curb road crashes, we needed to gradually ensure safe vehicles, safe drivers and improve traffic management. But we didn't.""

There are thousands of unfit and illegal vehicles on the roads and the fitness clearances given by Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) remain questionable, he said.
